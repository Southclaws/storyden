ITT: Post your desk or if you're a bit more mobile, post your travel work gear, or both!



Gear:



- Macbook Pro 2015, it has some memory and some gigahertz, not a clue how much, it works and that's the main thing.

- Logitech K380 keyboard: I chose this keyboard because it has the exact same dimensions as the keyboard on the laptop itself, so I can switch between them without typos.

- Roost Laptop Stand: I have this because it raises the laptop screen to eye height so I'm not hunched over like an old man while working, obviously this also raises the keyboard too, hence the need for a separate keyboard. It may seem like an odd setup but I'd rather avoid the neck and spine problems! Besides, it's well under 1kg for both of these pieces of hardware so it's perfect for travel.

- Logitech MX Master: My favourite wireless mouse. The wheel can spin freely so when I'm bored I try and spin it as fast as possible. It's very satisfying.



And that's it. I do everything on these 4 products (apart from SA:MP... because, well, Mac OS)



Here's my current desk in my place in London, I don't have a good photo because I'm not there right now:

And here's my setup at this moment in time - I'm back in my hometown for the weekend and this is my old room with some semi-old stuff:

The extra bits there are:



- Some kind of Asus monitor: not sure which, it's 3 years old.

- Tibo Plus 2 Active Bluetooth Speakers: Nice and loud. Shame I never use them now since they are here.

- Tascam US-2x2: back from the days of audio/video/music stuff - this is a great little interface for input of mics/instruments as well as an output device for the speakers.

- Wacom Intuos 5 Touch: I do a bit of design work every now and then and this really comes in handy for painting and manipulating bezier curves.
