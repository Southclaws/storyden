# Running Storyden locally

## Docker

```sh
docker run ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden
```

This will start the full stack (API and web interface) accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Containerless

We don't currently ship release binaries for all systems so in order to run without using a container image, you must compile from source.

For the backend, that's as simple as `go build ./cmd/backend` in the project root and the frontend is a standard Next.js app so you can use `yarn build` in the `web/` directory.
