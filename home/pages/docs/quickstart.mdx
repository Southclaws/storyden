# Quickstart

Start your stopwatch, let's get a community up and running in record time!

Storyden values modern approaches and simplicity. The primary way to spin up an instance is via Docker. We provide images for just the backend, just the frontend or all in one image.

The simplest way is to use the all-in-one image. This will spin up a Storyden instance with the backend and frontend all in one container. The default storage is SQLite which is powerful enough for production use on small to medium sized sites.
