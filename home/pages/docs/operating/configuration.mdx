title: Configuration via Environment Variables
description: Reference for configuring Storyden with environment variables.

# Configuration

"Configuration" throughout the documentation and codebase refers to these variables which are statically set when the process launches. Changing them requires a restart, however they don't need to be changed much once set.

Configuration is done via environment variables. The following variables are available:

## Core parameters

These settings are necessary to customise for pretty much all production installations.

### `PRODUCTION`

> default: `false`

Used for logging and switching some behaviour to use mocks instead of real services.

When true:
- logs will be output in JSON.
- emails will be logged instead of sent.
- SMS messages will be logged instead of sent.
- other behaviour that, generally, only developers of Storyden will care about.

### `DATABASE_URL`

> default: a SQLite file located at `./data/data.db`

This specifies the primary database Storyden will persist all its main data in. It can accept Postgres or SQLite URL-style strings.

### `LISTEN_ADDR`

> default: `0.0.0.0:8000`

The interface bind address. Usually you won't ever need to change this.

### `COOKIE_DOMAIN`

> default: `localhost`

This is important as it affects the ability for users to authenticate. It's used for both cookies and WebAuthn.


Warning: Changing this will break WebAuthn/Passkey sessions. There's a planned workaround coming but currently it's not recommended you switch domains if you allow users to authenticate with WebAuthn/Passkey.

### `SESSION_KEY`

> default: `0000000000000000`

An encryption key for secure cookies. Do not leave this as the default value for production installations. Changing this value will invalidate all active sessions.

### `PUBLIC_WEB_ADDRESS`

> default: `http://localhost:3000`

The public address for the frontend application. Change this to your production frontend URL with which you access the web application from via a browser. In production it should not have a port number and should use https.

## Optional

### `ASSET_STORAGE_TYPE`

> default: empty string - local filesystem storage

When unset, all persistent storage of files (avatars, uploads, assets, etc) will use the local filesystem.

When set to `s3`, the other `S3_` prefixed variables are required and all persistent storage of files will use S3.

### `ASSET_STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH`

When `ASSET_STORAGE_TYPE` specifies local file storage, this variable controls where the files are stored.

### S3 Configuration

The following variables are required when `ASSET_STORAGE_TYPE` is set to `s3`.

- `S3_ENDPOINT`
- `S3_BUCKET`
- `S3_REGION`
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY`
- `S3_SECRET_KEY`

## Internal

These are often used during development of Storyden itself, plugins or frontends and rarely need to be set by end-users.

### `LOG_LEVEL`

> default: `info`

See [`zapcore.Level`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.uber.org/zap/zapcore#Level).

### `RUN_FRONTEND`

> default: (empty)

Internal or advanced use only. A directory path that, when non-empty, be used to run the frontend Next.js app from.

The all-in-one Docker image uses this to ensure the frontend process is a child process of the backend process and they start/stop together. If you're self-hosting outside of Docker, you should not need to use this because it's simpler to use your preferred job management solution (such as systemd) to manage both processes independently.
