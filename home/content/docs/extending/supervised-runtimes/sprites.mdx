title: Sprites
---

The Sprites runtime runs supervised plugins in remote isolated runtimes managed by [Sprites](https://sprites.dev/), instead of running plugin processes on your Storyden host.

## Why use Sprites

- stronger runtime isolation for supervised plugins
- no plugin process execution on your Storyden machine
- useful when you want tighter risk boundaries for third-party plugins

## Configuration

Set:

```bash
PLUGIN_RUNTIME_PROVIDER=sprites
SPRITES_API_KEY=...
```

`SPRITES_API_KEY` is required when using the Sprites provider.

Also ensure your `PUBLIC_API_ADDRESS` is publicly reachable from Sprites, since supervised plugins need to connect back to Storyden RPC at `/rpc`.

See [Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/configuration) for environment variable details.

## Billing and rough cost estimate

Sprites is a separate billed service. It is billed by Sprites, not by your VPS/hosting provider.

  Storyden plugins are background services that do not go to sleep. This means
  you will not benefit from scale-to-zero semantics or granular hourly billing.

Pricing source: [Sprites billing](https://sprites.dev/#billing). (Checked February 22, 2026.)

Using their posted rates and minimum active usage floors, a plugin that runs 24/7 for a typical month (~730 hours) comes out roughly to:

- CPU floor: `0.0625 vCPU * 730h * $0.07` = about `$3.19/month`
- Memory floor: `0.25 GB * 730h * $0.04375` = about `$7.98/month`
- Total compute floor per always-on plugin: about `$11.18/month`

Storage is extra (but usually small for typical plugin workloads):

- 1 GB hot NVMe cache for the month: about `$0.50`
- 1 GB stored state for the month: about `$0.02`

So a practical ballpark for one always-on lightweight plugin is about $12/month, plus whatever storage and additional runtime usage you may add on top.

Rates can change, so treat this as an estimate, not a quote.

## Notes

- Storyden still manages supervised lifecycle (start/stop/restart/logging).
- External plugins do not use supervised runtime providers.
- Security model details: [Security -> Runtime boundaries](/docs/extending/security#runtime-boundaries).
