title: Local
---

The Local runtime runs supervised plugins as normal child processes on the same machine as Storyden.

## Why use Local

- simplest setup
- no third-party runtime account required
- easiest option for self-hosted instances where you fully trust your plugins

## Important boundary

Local runtime means local trust.

If you install a supervised plugin from someone else, that code runs on your machine with your machine's network and filesystem visibility.

Read [Security](/docs/extending/security#runtime-boundaries) before installing third-party plugins.

## Configuration

Set:

```bash
PLUGIN_RUNTIME_PROVIDER=local
```

This is the default provider if you don't set anything.

Runtime provider configuration is documented in [Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/configuration).

## Notes

- Supervised plugin logs are available in the plugin Logs tab.
- Storyden manages start/stop/restart for supervised plugins.
- External plugins are unaffected by runtime provider choice.
