title: Extending Storyden
description: Add custom behaviour to your Storyden site with plugins.
---

Storyden plugins let you add custom behaviour to your community site without editing Storyden itself.

If you want Storyden to better match how your community works, this is where that starts.

## What is a Plugin?

Plugins in Storyden are just regular programs. Any program can be a plugin if it speaks Storyden RPC. There are two plugin modes:

- Supervised
- External

You can learn more about the architecture of plugins in the [Plugin Model](/docs/extending/model) section.

### Supervised plugins

Supervised plugins are much like browser extensions. You give Storyden a `.zip` file containing the plugin code and some metadata, Storyden unpacks this and runs the program on the configured runtime provider. It then supervises the process, recording logs and restarting it if it crashes.

<Callout type="info" title="Sprites">
  You can run Supervised plugins on [Sprites](https://sprites.dev)! Sprites is a
  hardware-isolated execution environment for small workloads built by
  [Fly.io](https://fly.io). This is a great option for running plugins in a
  secure way without running untrusted plugins on the same machine as Storyden.

Read [Security -> Runtime boundaries](/docs/extending/security#runtime-boundaries) before installing third-party plugins.

Runtime-specific docs:

- [Local runtime](/docs/extending/supervised-runtimes/local)
- [Sprites runtime](/docs/extending/supervised-runtimes/sprites)

### External plugins

External plugins run elsewhere, not supervised by Storyden itself. These plugins have two primary use cases:

- Development: when you're developing a plugin, you will run it as an external plugin to make the edit-run-debug cycle faster.
- Advanced and custom use cases: if your plugin needs its own software development lifecycle and deployment process, external plugins are effectively just normal software that you are responsible for managing.

External plugins can also just be other apps, you can import the Storyden SDK libraries or generate your own and embed into your app so it can communicate and behave as if it were a plugin.

However, Storyden will not handle log collection or restarting of external plugins. That's up to you.

For token handling and connection semantics, see [Security -> RPC authentication model](/docs/extending/security#rpc-authentication-model).

## Manifest

Every plugin, supervised or external, has a manifest. If you distribute a plugin on the web, whether it's intended to be supervised or external, it must have a manifest describing its capabilities and requests. See [Manifest](/docs/extending/manifest) for more information.
