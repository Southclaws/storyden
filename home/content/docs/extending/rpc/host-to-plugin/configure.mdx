title: configure
description: Host to Plugin RPC method.
---

`configure` is a **Host to Plugin** method.

<Callout type="info">
  This page is generated from `api/rpc/host-to-plugin/configure.yaml`.
</Callout>

## Types

- Request type: `RPCRequestConfigure`
- Response type: `RPCResponseConfigure`

## Request contract

Request sent by the host to the plugin to provide configuration settings. The params object can contain any key-value pairs defined by the plugin in its manifest "configuration_schema" field and the plugin should validate and apply these settings to its internal state.
If configuration changes require a plugin to restart, the plugin should cleanly shut down with a zero exit code so that the Host can restart if it is a Supervised plugin. If it's an external plugin, the plugin itself is responsible for this behavior based on the plugin's lifecycle design.


Required fields:
- `method`
- `params`



## Response contract

Confirm that the configuration was received and applied correctly.


Required fields:
- `ok`



## Notes

- JSON-RPC base request/response envelope types are defined in `api/rpc/rpc.yaml`.
- Union wiring between host/plugin method sets is defined in `api/plugin.yaml`.
