title: Database
description: Simple, built-in, default keyword-based search
---

The default search provider, which uses simple database-driven keyword matching. This requires no additional configuration or infrastructure and works out of the box.

It searches for keywords in titles, descriptions, and content (of threads, replies and pages) using simple keyword matching via SQL queries against the database.

```bash
SEARCH_PROVIDER=database
# or, with SEARCH_PROVIDER not set at all, this is the default.
```

<Callout title="When to use this">
  A small community wiki with a few hundred library pages and discussion
  threads. Members search occasionally for specific topics or keywords. The
  community is hosted on a single server with a SQLite or PostgreSQL database.
</Callout>

Upsides:

- Getting started quickly without additional dependencies

Limitations:

- Limited query capabilities compared to full-text search engines
- Performance degrades with content volume

For a low-effort upgrade from database search, [Bleve](./bleve) is the recommended approach.

## Technical details

The `database` search provider is literally just a `... where xyz ilike '%<query>%'`. This involves a full table scan so if you're planning to operate a large (over 100k threads, 1m replies, etc) community, this search provider will degrade as your data grows.
