title: Configuration via Environment Variables
description: Reference for configuring Storyden with environment variables.
---

"Configuration" throughout the documentation and codebase refers to these variables which are statically set when the process launches. Changing them requires a restart, however they don't need to be changed much once set.

The term "Settings" is distinct from these and refers to runtime-configurable values which are stored in the database and not via environment variables. These can be changed at any time via the API or the Admin settings page.

## General

These settings general infrastructure-level configuration settings for managing a Storyden deployment.

### `LOG_LEVEL`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`info`</td></tr>
</table>

Can be set to either:

- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`

### `LOG_FORMAT`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

Can be set to either:

- `(not set)` (default) somewhat human readable "logfmt" format logs for simple setups
- `dev` for developer-friendly logs, with colours and attributes on separate lines for readability
- `json` for machine-readable logs, mainly for log aggregators, etc.

### `RUN_FRONTEND`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>(empty string)</td></tr>
</table>

Determines whether or not the backend service will also start the frontend Node.js process. When empty, it will not

When a path is provided, Storyden will execute `node <path>` to start the frontend process. This is used by the fullstack Docker image to start the frontend process in the same container as the backend.

### `PROXY_FRONTEND_ADDRESS`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>url (e.g. http://example.com)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>(empty string)</td></tr>
</table>

Used in conjunction with `RUN_FRONTEND`. This is the address that the frontend will be available at. This is used by the fullstack Docker image to proxy requests that don't match any `/api` or other routes to the frontend process.

In the default `fullstack` image, this is set to `http://localhost:3000` which is the default port for the Next.js process.

## Development tools

Configuration settings for aiding in development of Storyden clients.

### `DEV_CHAOS_SLOW_MODE`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>duration (e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

Simulates slow requests.

This will add a random delay between zero and this value to all requests. This is useful for testing how the client handles slow responses.

### `DEV_CHAOS_SLOW_MODE_QUEUE`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>duration (e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

Simulates slow message delivery in the internal message queue.

This will add a random delay between zero and this value to all messages in the internal message queue. This is useful for testing how the client handles delayed message processing.

### `DEV_CHAOS_FAIL_RATE`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>float (e.g. `1.0`, `1.5`)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

A value between 0 and 1 which simulates failed requests.

This will add a random failure to all requests. This is useful for testing how the client handles "internal server error" responses.

## Core configuration

Configuration settings for core functionality, pretty much all of these will need to be configured for production installations, excepting perhaps `LISTEN_ADDR`.

### `DATABASE_URL`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`sqlite://data/data.db?_pragma=foreign_keys(1)`</td></tr>
</table>

The database URL to connect to. This can be a SQLite, PostgreSQL, or CockroachDB URL.

The accepted schemes for this URL are:
- `sqlite://` or `sqlite3://` for SQLite or Litestream.
- `postgres://` or `postgresql://` for PostgreSQL, CockroachDB and any other PostgreSQL-compatible database
- `libsql://` for Turso remote SQLite. **Note:** This is currently experimental, only remote Turso databases are supported.

### `LISTEN_ADDR`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`0.0.0.0:8000`</td></tr>
</table>

The interface on which the API service will for HTTP requests.

Typically, in a containerised environment, this should be all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`.)

### `PUBLIC_WEB_ADDRESS`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>url (e.g. http://example.com)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`http://localhost:3000`</td></tr>
</table>

The address at which the web frontend will be hosted.

This must be set to the public URL that users of the instance will access the frontend client. It is used to determine things such as cookie domain attributes, CORS policy, WebAuthn attributes and other necessary settings. The scheme may be used by some internal components to determine whether the instance is running in a secure context or not.

This is by default `http://localhost:3000` when running locally, or when deploying to production, `https://<your-domain>`.

### `PUBLIC_API_ADDRESS`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>url (e.g. http://example.com)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`http://localhost:8000`</td></tr>
</table>

The address at which the public API will be accessible.

This is also used for things such as cookies, CORS, etc.

Please note that both the public API address and public web address must share the same root domain name as Storyden cookies are configured to be issued under this assumption. It also makes a lot of cross-origin and cookie configurations easier to make secure.

## Rate limiting

Storyden includes a rate limiter to reduce abusive traffic (scraping, brute force, etc.)
while staying friendly to normal "bursty" browsing.

The limiter uses a sliding-window counter implemented as fixed time buckets (a hash map of
`bucket_timestamp` → `count`). Each request increments the current bucket. To decide whether
a request is allowed, Storyden sums all buckets within the last `RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD`.

Rate limits are keyed by the client’s IP address (respecting proxy-forwarded headers).

Rate-limit state is stored in-memory by default. If `CACHE_PROVIDER` is configured, state is
stored in the cache provider instead.

### `RATE_LIMIT`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`integer` (number without decimal point)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`5000`</td></tr>
</table>

Maximum number of "units" allowed within the sliding window defined by `RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD`.

Most incoming requests will consume `1` unit for authenticated users, and `RATE_LIMIT_GUEST_COST`
units for unauthenticated (guest) visitors.

Certain endpoints are more expensive by default, such as those that trigger password resets, sending emails, etc.

You can also configure custom overrides in the System Settings screen. However, you cannot configure custom overrides via environment variables.

### `RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>duration (e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`1h`</td></tr>
</table>

Sliding window duration used to enforce `RATE_LIMIT`.

On each request, Storyden considers the total number of units consumed in the last
`RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD` (not aligned to the hour/minute boundary).

### `RATE_LIMIT_BUCKET`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>duration (e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`1m`</td></tr>
</table>

Bucket size (granularity) used to approximate the sliding window.

Requests are counted into discrete time buckets of this size (e.g. 1 minute). When
checking the limit, Storyden sums all buckets whose timestamps fall within the last
`RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD` and discards older buckets.

Smaller buckets = more accurate sliding-window behaviour but more storage/CPU overhead.
Larger buckets = cheaper but "chunkier" enforcement.

Rule of thumb: set this to ~1/60 of `RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD` (e.g. 1m buckets for a 1h period).

### `RATE_LIMIT_GUEST_COST`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`integer` (number without decimal point)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`1`</td></tr>
</table>

Cost multiplier applied to unauthenticated (guest) requests.

Example: if set to 5, each guest request consumes 5 units from the same `RATE_LIMIT`
budget, effectively allowing guests ~1/5th the throughput of authenticated users.

## Telemetry and monitoring

Configuration for monitoring via OpenTelemetry-compatible software.

### `OTEL_PROVIDER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>(empty string)</td></tr>
</table>

Either:
- `otlp` for any standard OpenTelemetry collector.
- `sentry` for Sentry (which is OpenTelemetry-compatible, however requires its own specific configuration.)
- `logger` for local logging to the console. This is only really useful for Storyden developers and is very noisy.

### `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>url (e.g. http://example.com)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>(empty string)</td></tr>
</table>

The collector endpoint for sending OTEL data.

### `SENTRY_DSN`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>(empty string)</td></tr>
</table>

When `OTEL_PROVIDER` is set to `sentry`, this is the DSN for the Sentry project.

## Email

Email sending configuration. This must be enabled in order to enable email-based authentication and password reset functionality.

When enabling email features, you must also set `JWT_SECRET` as this is used to sign the email tokens for password resets and other features.

### `EMAIL_PROVIDER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

Either:

- unset (default) for no email sending. Email sending is not a requirement for a production deployment.
- `sendgrid` for SendGrid based email sending.
- `mock` for logging emails to the console. Only useful for Storyden developers and testing.

### `SENDGRID_FROM_NAME`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The name that will be used as the sender name for emails sent via SendGrid.

This is typically the name of your community or organisation.

### `SENDGRID_FROM_ADDRESS`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The email address that will be used as the sender address for emails sent via SendGrid.

This is typically a no-reply address, such as `no-reply@<your-domain>`.

### `SENDGRID_API_KEY`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The API key for the SendGrid account. This is required for sending emails via SendGrid.

This is typically a long string of characters that you can generate in the SendGrid dashboard.

## Authentication

Authentication providers configuration. These are all optional, you can choose to enable any combination of them to allow members of your community to sign up and sign in using a third party provider.

In order to enable any of these providers, you must set a JWT secret. This is used to sign the state objects for validating the OAuth2 flow.

### `JWT_SECRET`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`[]byte`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The secret key used to sign JWT tokens. This is used for authentication and should be kept secret.

This is typically a long string of characters that you can generate using a secure random generator such as `openssl rand -hex 12`.

The JWT secret is required if you enable any of the OAuth providers or enable email features. This is because JWTs are used to verify callbacks as well as verify password-reset and other tokens.

### `OAUTH_GOOGLE_ENABLED`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>boolean (`true` or `false`, case sensitive)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

Enable Google SSO authentication.

### `OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

</table>

The client ID for the Discord OAuth2 application.

### `OAUTH_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The client secret for the Discord OAuth2 application.

### `OAUTH_KEYCLOAK_ENABLED`

<table>

</table>

The client secret for the Keycloak OAuth2 application.

### `OAUTH_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER_URL`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>url (e.g. http://example.com)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The issuer/discovery URL for the Keycloak realm (e.g. https://auth.example.com/realms/YourRealm).

## SMS

SMS sending configuration. This must be enabled in order to support SMS-based authentication.

### `SMS_PROVIDER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

Either:

- unset (default) for no SMS sending. SMS sending is not a requirement for a production deployment.
- `twilio` for Twilio based SMS sending.
- `mock` for logging SMS to the console. Only useful for Storyden developers and testing.

### `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The account SID for the Twilio account.

This is typically a long string of characters that you can view in the Twilio dashboard.

### `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The phone number that will be used as the sender number for SMS sent via Twilio.

### `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The auth token for the Twilio account. This is required for sending SMS via Twilio.

This is typically a long string of characters that you can generate in the Twilio dashboard.

## Assets/file storage

Configuration for storing files such as avatars, uploaded images, etc.

### `ASSET_STORAGE_TYPE`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

Either:

- `local` for local file storage.
- `s3` for any Amazon S3-compatible storage, such as S3 itself (obviously...), Google Cloud Storage, Cloudflare R2, Minio, etc.

### `ASSET_STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

When `ASSET_STORAGE_TYPE` is set to `local`, this is the path to the directory where files will be stored.

### `S3_SECURE`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>boolean (`true` or `false`, case sensitive)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`true`</td></tr>
</table>

When `ASSET_STORAGE_TYPE` is set to `s3`, this determines whether or not to use HTTPS for the S3 connection. You should always set this to `true` unless your S3-compatible storage provider is internally but not publicly accessible, such as in a Kubernetes cluster or running on the same host.

### `S3_ENDPOINT`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The endpoint for the S3-compatible storage provider. This is typically the base URL of the provider, such as `https://s3.amazonaws.com` for AWS S3, or `https://storage.googleapis.com` for Google Cloud Storage, etc.

### `S3_BUCKET`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The bucket name for Storyden assets to be stored in.

### `S3_REGION`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

Most S3-compatible storage providers require a region to be specified. This is typically the region in which the bucket is located, such as `us-east-1` for AWS S3.

However, some providers do not use regions but S3-compatible clients still require this to be set. In most cases, the provider will give you a value for this, such as `auto` when using Cloudflare R2.

### `S3_ACCESS_KEY`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The access key for the S3-compatible storage provider.

### `S3_SECRET_KEY`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The secret key for the S3-compatible storage provider.

## Cache

Configuration for cachine. Caching is optional in Storyden, but is recommended for larger deployments to reduce process memory usage.

### `CACHE_PROVIDER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>(empty string)</td></tr>
</table>

When empty, caching will use an efficient in-memory store. This is usually fine for small to medium-sized deployments however it's worth keeping an eye on your deployment's machine memory usage.

When set to `redis`, Storyden will use Redis as a cache provider. This is recommended for larger deployments that receive a lot of traffic. The cache provider is also used for the rate limiter so that it can be shared across multiple instances of Storyden.

This is necessary for deploying replica instances of Storyden that are backed by the same persistence layers (database, asset storage, etc.)

### `REDIS_URL`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>url (e.g. http://example.com)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>(empty string)</td></tr>
</table>

The Redis URL to connect to.

This is a full URL with `redis://` as the scheme. You can set the username and password using the URL format, for example: `redis://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>`.

## Search features

Configuration for search features. This is not required for Storyden to run, by default search uses a simple database-driven keyword search. However, for larger deployments and better search quality, it is recommended to configure a search provider.

### `SEARCH_PROVIDER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`database`</td></tr>
</table>

Either:

- `database` for the default database-driven search.  This is not recommended for larger deployments as it does not scale well and has limited search quality.
- `bleve` for Bleve. This is a local full-text search engine that is fast and efficient for small to medium-sized deployments. This is best used when you are using local disk storage, such as SQLite and local asset storage.
- `redis` for Redisearch. This is a fast and efficient search provider that is recommended for larger deployments. This is recommended if your environment is ephemeral and you're already using external providers for database and asset storage.

### `SEARCH_INDEX_CHUNK_SIZE`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`integer` (number without decimal point)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`1000`</td></tr>
</table>

When using `SEARCH_PROVIDER` set to either `bleve` or `redis`, this is the number of items that will be indexed in a single batch.

Increasing this value will improve indexing performance, but will also increase memory usage during indexing.

### `BLEVE_PATH`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`data/bleve`</td></tr>
</table>

The path to the directory where Bleve will store search indexes. Only used when `SEARCH_PROVIDER` is set to `bleve`.

### `REDIS_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`storyden`</td></tr>
</table>

The name of the Redis search index. Only used when `SEARCH_PROVIDER` is set to `redis`.

## Message queue

Configuration for message/job queue. This is not required for Storyden to run, but it can improve performance, reliability and reduce memory usage in larger deployments.

### `QUEUE_TYPE`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`internal`</td></tr>
</table>

Either:

- Default (no value): in-memory Go channels. This is fast and efficient, but not persistent across restarts and will add a bit of memory usage to the process.
- `amqp`: RabbitMQ. This is a persistent message queue that is fast and reliable. It is recommended for larger deployments and is necessary for deploying replica instances of Storyden.

### `AMQP_URL`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/`</td></tr>
</table>

The RabbitMQ URL to connect to.

This is a full URL with `amqp://` as the scheme. You can set the username and password using the URL format, for example: `amqp://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>`.

The default value is `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/` which is the default RabbitMQ URL.

Storyden does not currently support `amqps://` (secure) URLs, but this will be added soon.

### `QUEUE_MAX_RETRIES`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`integer` (number without decimal point)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`5`</td></tr>
</table>

The maximum number of times a failed message will be retried before being moved to the dead letter queue.

Messages are retried with exponential backoff starting at 1 second and doubling each time up to a maximum of 1 minute between retries.

### `QUEUE_RETRY_INITIAL_INTERVAL`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>duration (e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`1s`</td></tr>
</table>

The initial interval to wait before the first retry attempt.

### `QUEUE_RETRY_MAX_INTERVAL`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>duration (e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`1m`</td></tr>
</table>

The maximum interval to wait between retry attempts. The exponential backoff will not exceed this value.

## Plugins

Configuration for the plugin system. Plugins extend Storyden with custom functionality via a process-based runtime.

### `PLUGIN_DATA_PATH`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`./data/plugins`</td></tr>
</table>

The directory where plugin files will be extracted and stored. Each plugin gets its own subdirectory keyed by the plugin installation ID.

This directory should be persistent and writable by the Storyden process.

### `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_PROVIDER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`local`</td></tr>
</table>

The plugin runtime provider. Different runtime providers offer different security guarantees. The simplest is `local` which just runs the plugin as a child process on the same machine as Storyden.

- `local`: runs supervised plugins as local child processes on the same machine as Storyden.

### `PLUGIN_MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`integer` (number without decimal point)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`3`</td></tr>
</table>

Maximum number of consecutive restart attempts for a supervised plugin before marking it as errored.

When a plugin crashes during startup (before the runtime crash threshold), the restart counter increments. After exceeding this limit, the plugin transitions to an error state and stops attempting restarts.

### `PLUGIN_MAX_BACKOFF_DURATION`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>duration (e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`60s`</td></tr>
</table>

Maximum backoff duration between plugin restart attempts.

Restart delays use exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ...) capped at this maximum value.

### `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_CRASH_THRESHOLD`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>duration (e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`30s`</td></tr>
</table>

Time threshold to distinguish between startup crashes and runtime crashes.

If a plugin runs successfully for longer than this duration before crashing, it's considered a "runtime crash" and the restart counter is reset. This allows plugins that crash after running for a while (hours/days) to restart without being penalized by the startup crash limit.

### `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_CRASH_BACKOFF`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>duration (e.g. 1h, 1m, 1s)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`5s`</td></tr>
</table>

Backoff duration used specifically for runtime crashes (crashes that occur after the plugin has been running for longer than the runtime crash threshold).

This is typically shorter than the exponential backoff used for startup crashes, as runtime crashes are less likely to be configuration issues.

## Artificial intelligence/language models

Configuration for optional AI features. These can be useful for organising large amounts of library pages and threads, but it can also provide other features such as recommendations and ask-based conversational searching.

### `MCP_ENABLED`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>boolean (`true` or `false`, case sensitive)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`false`</td></tr>
</table>

Enables the Model Context Provider server, accessible via SSE at `/mcp`.

This is used to integrate Storyden into agentic workflow engines and other language model tooling.

See [the documentation](https://storyden.org/docs/introduction/mcp) for more information.

### `LANGUAGE_MODEL_PROVIDER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The provider for language model features.

`openai` is currently the only supported provider.

### `OPENAI_API_KEY`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

When `LANGUAGE_MODEL_PROVIDER` is set to `openai`, this is the API key for the OpenAI API.

### `ASKER_PROVIDER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>(empty string)</td></tr>
</table>

The Asker feature provides a conversational interface for exploring the community's content across library pages, threads, links, profiles, etc. It is separate from the language model provider as some providers support different features.

This can be set to either:

- `openai` for OpenAI
- `perplexity` for Perplexity AI - note that Perplexity does not currently support all the features necessary to be a `LANGUAGE_MODEL_PROVIDER` so it is only available as an `ASKER_PROVIDER`.

### `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

If `ASKER_PROVIDER` is set to `perplexity`, this is the API key for the Perplexity API.

## Semdex

The Semdex is a semantic index that provides vector-based storage of content. This is used for things like recommendations, search, etc.

 The Semdex works with the language model provider to create embeddings of content. Thus, enabling the Semdex requires a `LANGUAGE_MODEL_PROVIDER` to be set.

### `SEMDEX_PROVIDER`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>(empty string)</td></tr>
</table>

Either:
- `chromem` for an experimental local vector database. This is not recommended for use in large deployments as it's rather slow and memory-hungry.
- `weaviate` for Weaviate, a self-hostable or managed vector database.
- `pinecone` for Pinecone, a fully managed vector database.

## Local Semdex

Configuration for when `SEMDEX_PROVIDER` is set to `chromem`.

### `SEMDEX_LOCAL_PATH`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>`data/semdex`</td></tr>
</table>

The path to the directory where Chromem will store vector indexes.

## Weaviate Semdex

Configuration for when `SEMDEX_PROVIDER` is set to `weaviate`.

### `WEAVIATE_URL`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The Weaviate API URL. This can be set to a self-hosted instance of Weaviate or the Weaviate Cloud API.

### `WEAVIATE_API_TOKEN`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

For self-hosted Weaviate where authentication is enabled, or when using Weaviate Cloud.

### `WEAVIATE_CLASS_NAME`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The class name for Weaviate. This value actually controls which model is used for embeddings and other configuration. In future, there will be a more flexible configuration for Weaviate.

Value values are:

- `text2vec-transformers`: requires that the Weaviate instance is using the `text2vec-transformers` module. This is for calculating embeddings locally using a GPU (or very slowly, using a CPU.) This is only available when self-hosting Weaviate.
- `text2vec-openai`: requires that the Weaviate instance is using the `text2vec-openai` module. This uses OpenAI's API to calculate embeddings. This works on both self-hosted and Weaviate Cloud instances.

## Pinecone Semdex

Configuration for when `SEMDEX_PROVIDER` is set to `pinecone`.

### `PINECONE_API_KEY`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

Your Pinecone API key. This is required for all Pinecone API requests.

### `PINECONE_INDEX`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>`string`</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

The index name that Storyden will use in your Pinecone workspace.

### `PINECONE_DIMENSIONS`

<table>
<tr><td>type</td><td>integer (e.g. `1`, `2`, `3`)</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>none</td></tr>
</table>

This value is dependent on the underlying OpenAI configuration. Currently this is static and set to 3072 dimensions. In future, Storyden will provide more flexible configuration for language model providers.

### `PINECONE_CLOUD`
