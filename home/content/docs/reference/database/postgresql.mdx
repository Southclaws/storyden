title: PostgreSQL
description: A proven relational database for serious deployments
---

PostgreSQL is a long-standing, reliable relational database that scales from small community sites to large, high-traffic installations. It’s a common choice for self-hosted forums and content platforms where data integrity, flexibility, and long-term stability matter.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/storyden
```

<Callout title="When to use PostgreSQL">
  High-traffic communities where a single SQLite instance can't keep up, or when
  you're already running PostgreSQL for other applications and want to keep
  everything in one place.
</Callout>

## Supported PostgreSQL-Compatible Databases

Storyden works with PostgreSQL and any PostgreSQL-compatible database or service:

- **PostgreSQL** - The original, available everywhere
- **CockroachDB** - Distributed SQL with PostgreSQL compatibility
- **Neon** - Serverless PostgreSQL with branching
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL with additional features and tooling

Any service that speaks the PostgreSQL wire protocol should work. If you encounter compatibility issues with a specific provider, [open an issue](https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden/issues/new).

## Performance Characteristics

PostgreSQL excels at concurrent reads and writes. Unlike SQLite's single-writer limitation, PostgreSQL can handle many concurrent writers, making it suitable for high-traffic deployments with a focus on more content being posted.

Upsides:

- Native support for multiple concurrent writers
- Horizontal scaling across multiple Storyden instances
- Rich ecosystem of extensions and tools
- Managed service options from every major cloud provider

Considerations:

- Requires separate database service to operate
- More complex operational overhead than SQLite
- Network latency between application and database
- Higher memory and CPU requirements than SQLite
