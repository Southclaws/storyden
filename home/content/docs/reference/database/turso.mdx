description: Distributed SQLite with global edge replication
---

[Turso](https://turso.tech/) is a managed service built on libSQL that provides globally distributed SQLite-compatible databases with edge replication.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-database.turso.io?authToken=your_auth_token
```

<Callout title="When to use libSQL/Turso">
  If you're already deploying your Storyden instance to a globally replicated
  infrastructure platform such as Fly.io or Cloudflare. Turso replicates your
  SQLite database to edge locations worldwide, providing fast reads from the
  nearest region. Also useful when you want SQLite's simplicity with the ability
  to run multiple application instances.
</Callout>

Turso brings the operational simplicity of SQLite to distributed environments. You get SQLite's developer experience with the scaling capabilities typically requiring PostgreSQL.
