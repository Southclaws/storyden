description: Enable Discord authentication for gaming and community platforms
---

Discord OAuth allows members to sign in using their Discord accounts. This is ideal for gaming communities, Discord server-integrated forums, and communities where members already use Discord.

## Configuration

Set these environment variables to enable Discord OAuth:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
OAUTH_DISCORD_ENABLED=true
OAUTH_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OAUTH_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

## Setting Up Discord OAuth

Create a new application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and configure OAuth2 settings:

- **Redirect URI**: `https://your-domain.com/auth/oauth_discord/callback`

Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the OAuth2 settings.

## Local Development

For local development, add this redirect URL to your Discord Application:

```
http://localhost:3000/auth/oauth_discord/callback
```

Make sure `PUBLIC_WEB_ADDRESS` is set to `http://localhost:3000`.
