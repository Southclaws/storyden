title: OAuth2 Providers
description: Configure third-party authentication for your Storyden community
---

Storyden supports OAuth2 authentication with popular identity providers, allowing members to sign in using their existing accounts. OAuth providers require JWT_SECRET to be configured for state validation during the authentication flow.

## Prerequisites

Before enabling any OAuth provider, you must configure a JWT secret:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
```

Generate a secure random secret using:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

The JWT secret is used to sign and verify the OAuth state tokens that protect against CSRF attacks during the authentication flow.

## Available Providers

Each provider has a unique identifier and callback URL that you'll need when configuring the OAuth application with the provider.

| Provider | Identifier       | Callback URL                                           | Setup Guide                                      |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Google   | `oauth_google`   | `https://your-domain.com/auth/oauth_google/callback`   | [Google Setup](/docs/reference/oauth/google)     |
| GitHub   | `oauth_github`   | `https://your-domain.com/auth/oauth_github/callback`   | [GitHub Setup](/docs/reference/oauth/github)     |
| Discord  | `oauth_discord`  | `https://your-domain.com/auth/oauth_discord/callback`  | [Discord Setup](/docs/reference/oauth/discord)   |
| Keycloak | `oauth_keycloak` | `https://your-domain.com/auth/oauth_keycloak/callback` | [Keycloak Setup](/docs/reference/oauth/keycloak) |

<Callout type="info">
  Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain. Make sure
  `PUBLIC_WEB_ADDRESS` is set correctly as it determines the base URL for
  callbacks.
</Callout>

## User Profile Mapping

When a user signs in via OAuth for the first time, Storyden creates a new account with information from the OAuth provider:

- **Username/Handle**: Derived from the provider's username or email
- **Display Name**: Full name from the provider profile
- **Email**: Used to link the account and prevent duplicates/hijacking
- **OAuth Token**: Stored for the authentication method

Subsequent sign-ins with the same provider will match to the existing account by the OAuth provider's unique user ID.

## Security Considerations

- OAuth tokens are stored unencrypted in the database
- The `JWT_SECRET` must be kept secure
- Each OAuth provider requires separate client credentials
- Callback URLs must match exactly what's configured with the provider
- State tokens expire after 10 minutes for security
