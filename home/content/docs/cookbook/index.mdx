description: More than a static forum? Mix features together to make... more features?

The Cookbook contains practical guides and patterns for building and running communities with Storyden. These recipes show you how to use Storyden's features together to do neat things.

## What's in the Cookbook?

Unlike the introduction and reference, cookbook recipes show you compose together Storyden features.

Each recipe is designed to be:

- **Complete**: shows the full thing from start to finish
- **Practical**: based on real-world stuff
- **Actionable**: includes specific steps you can follow

## Contributing Recipes

Have a pattern or workflow that works well for your community? We'd love to add it to the cookbook! Open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden).
