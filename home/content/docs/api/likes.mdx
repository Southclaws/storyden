          Removes a like/vote from the authenticated account for the post. It
          will

          perform the inverse of any changes to the account's algorithm. Also is

          idempotent, so repeated use will do nothing after being actioned once.
        heading: like-post-remove
      - content: >
          Add a like/vote to a post. A "like" is pretty much what you'd expect
          for

          any modern social platform, it will inform the feed algorithm and the

          account's recommendations as well as listing the post on their
          profile.

          Idempotent operation where repeated use will do nothing.
        heading: like-post-add
      - content: Retreives all the likes that the given profile has given.
