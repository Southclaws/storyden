          Suspend an account - soft delete. This disables the ability for the
          account owner to log in and use the platform. It keeps the account on
          record for linkage to content so UI doesn't break. It does not change
          anything else about the account such as the avatar, name, etc.

      - content: Given the account is suspended, remove the suspended state.

          List all access keys for the entire instance. This is only available
          to

          admin accounts and is used to manage access keys from other accounts.
        heading: admin-access-key-list
      - content: |
          Revoke an access key. This will immediately invalidate the key and it
          will no longer be usable for authentication.
