title: Plugin Update Manifest
description: |
  Update the manifest for a plugin. This is used for development of plugins
  where the manifest may change frequently and it's useful to be able to
  update it without re-uploading the entire plugin bundle.

  This only works for External plugins that were created by uploading a 
  manifest directly. It does not work for Supervised plugins.
