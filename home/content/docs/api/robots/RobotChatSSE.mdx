description: |
  Send a message to a Robot and receive its response. This endpoint
  manages sessions automatically, creating new sessions as needed or
  continuing existing sessions based on the provided session ID.

  Each message sent to the Robot is processed according to its playbook
  and available tools, allowing it to perform actions or retrieve data
  as part of the conversation. The response from the Robot includes its
  reply message along with any actions taken during the interaction.

  This endpoint is a Server Sent Events (SSE) stream, meaning that the
  response is streamed back to the client in real-time as the Robot
  generates its reply.
