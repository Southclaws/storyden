title: Get a robot session
description: |
  Retrieve a specific robot session with all of its messages. Sessions can
  involve interactions with multiple Robots so the Robot is specified on
  each message. Messages may not be representative of exactly what is sent
  into a language model, as certain optimisations may be performed before
  this such as compaction, summarisation or removal of irrelevant context.

  Any member with "USE_ROBOTS" can see any other members' sessions and
  messages with a Robot. Robots are not considered private assistants, but
  rather shared tools for the team to use for managing their community.
