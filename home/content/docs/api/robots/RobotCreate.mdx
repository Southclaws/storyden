title: Create a robot
description: |
  Create a new Robot with the specified configuration. A Robot in Storyden
  consists of a name and description (for humans) as well as a playbook,
  and a set of available tools to interact with Storyden or plugins. The
  playbook is a detailed set of instructions that guides behaviour of the
  Robot to help it assist members in achieving a specific automation goal.
  Tools are available from either Storyden or plugins that allow it to
  perform actions or query data. Robots never need all tools and it's best
  to build goal-specific Robots with minimal sets of tools.
