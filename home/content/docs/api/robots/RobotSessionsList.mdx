description: |
  Get a paginated list of Robot sessions. These are chat sessions with the
  Robot system. One session may span multiple Robots as members can switch
  which Robot they are talking to mid conversation, or the Robot itself
  may choose to switch to another Robot to achieve a goal. A session is a
  representation of an entire conversation thread with the Robot system.

  You may include an account ID to filter sessions by account. Only those
  with "USE_ROBOTS" permission can use Robots, however sessions, messages
  and usage is not considered hidden to other accounts with the usage
  permission. Robots are intended as administrative or moderation tools
  to be shared among the team rather than private assistants.
