title: Node Comment Create
description: |
  Creates a "comment" on the specified node. A comment is just a regular
  thread. The target node must be published in order to create a comment.

  Since comments are just regular threads, once a node comment is created,
  any thread API can be used to interact with it. This includes editing,
  liking, adding to collections, replying and all moderation tools.

  Threads created this way have a default visibility of "unlisted" so they
  will not appear in the main feed. However, there's no restriction on
  visibility, so a comment can be created with a visibility of "published"
  which will echo the thread to the main feed. You can also specify a
  category for the thread so that it may appear in a category thread feed.

  This allows for flexible usage of node comments, for use-cases such as
  "Also share to feed" to encourage discussion from other contexts.
