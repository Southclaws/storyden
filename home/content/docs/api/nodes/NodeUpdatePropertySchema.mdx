title: Node Update Property Schema
description: |
  Updates the property schema of this node and its siblings. All children
  of a node use the same schema for properties resulting in a table-like
  structure and behaviour. Property schemas are loosely structured and can
  automatically cast their values sometimes. A failed cast will not change
  data and instead just yield an empty value when reading however changing
  the schema back to the original type (or a type compatible with what the
  type was before changing) will retain the original data upon next read.
  This permits clients to undo changes to the schema easily while allowing
  quick schema changes without the need to remove or update values before.
