title: Node Update Position
description: |
  Update the node's position in the tree, which optionally allows for 
  changing the node's parent either to another node or to `null` which
  severs the parent and moves the node to the root. This endpoint also
  allows for moving the node's sort position within either its current
  parent, or when moving it to a new parent. Use this operation for a
  draggable tree interface or a table interface.
