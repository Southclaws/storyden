          Retrieve all invitations for the authenticated account. This endpoint

          is useful for showing the user which invitations they have sent out
          and

          which ones have been accepted.


          If the requesting account is not an admin, the account_id query param 

          must be equal to the ID of the requesting session account's ID.


          If the requesting account is an admin, the account_id query param may

          be used to retrieve invitations for a specific account. Otherwise, the

          endpoint will return all invitations for all accounts.

          Create an invitation for the authenticated account. Responds with the

          invitation data which can be used to construct a public

          registration URL using the invitation's identifier which can be used
          in

          calls to registration operations to indicate the account was invited.

          Retrieve the details of an invitation by its identifier. This endpoint

          the client's registration flow.
