description: |
  A catch-all endpoint for tracking read states and other things that are
  not critical to the functioning of the platform. This endpoint is fire
  and forget and does not return any meaningful data. It is designed to
  be used with the `navigator.sendBeacon` API in browsers to mark things
  such as how far down a thread a member has read, or whether or not a
  Library Page has been visited recently. It may queue the work for later
  processing and is not guaranteed to be processed immediately or at all.
