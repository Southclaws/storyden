          Create a new event. When an event is created, a thread is also created
          which provides the means for discussion via the thread and reply APIs.
        heading: event-create
      - content: Get an event by its ID.
        heading: event-get
      - content: >
          Update an event. If the content field is updated, this is stored on
          the

          thread associated with the event, rather than the event itself. It's 

          possible to update that thread directly using `threads` operations.
        heading: event-update
      - content: Delete an event.
        heading: event-delete
      - content: >
          Remove a participant from an event. Same rules as
          EventParticipantUpdate

          where non-managing members may only remove themselves. Not
          soft-delete.
        heading: event-participant-remove
      - content: >
          Add a participant to an event or change an existing participant's
          state.


          If the requesting account is an admin or holds MANAGE_EVENTS
          permission,

          they can change the participation properties of any account.
          Otherwise,

          they can only change their own participation properties.


          For non-managing members (i.e. not an admin and not a host) this will

          follow a stricter state machine for the participation status. If the

          participation status is not set (no participation record is present)
          or

          set to "declined", the member may only set their status to "requested"

          if the event policy is set to "invite_only". Otherwise, they may set
          it

          to "attending". If the member is already set to one of these states,

          they may change it to "declined".


          A non-managing member cannot change their role and the default is

          "attendee", only managing members can change participant roles.


          If the event participation policy is set to "invite_only" then members

          can only set their status to "requested" or delete their
          participation.


          If the event participation policy is set to "closed", it's a no-op.


          Requests to this resource are idempotent given identical request
          bodies.

          It acts as a create-or-update action as participation is
          account-unique.
