  Add a link to the community bookmarks. This will also scrape the content
  at the site the link points to, if possible. If the submitted link is an
  invalid link for whatever reason (invalid URL structure or page is dead)
  then the API will fail. The metadata for the link is indexed on success.

  If the submitted link already exists it will be an idempotent operation,
  unless the body contains additional metadata. In these cases, the link's
  metadata will be updated with the new metadata and the URL is unchanged.

  When a link is submitted, it is first "cleaned" to remove any fragments.
