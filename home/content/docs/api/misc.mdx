          This endpoint returns the OpenAPI specification for the Storyden API
          in

          JSON format. This is useful for clients that want to dynamically load

          the API specification for documentation or code generation.

          This endpoint returns the OpenAPI documentation for the Storyden API
          in

          an interactive HTML format. This is useful for developers who want to

          explore the API and test endpoints without writing code.

          Get the basic forum installation info such as title, description, etc.


          This is a fully public endpoint as it drives the ability to render
          stuff

          like OpenGraph metadata, favicon, titles, descriptions, for crawlers.

      - content: Get the logo icon image.

          A catch-all endpoint for tracking read states and other things that
          are

          not critical to the functioning of the platform. This endpoint is fire

          and forget and does not return any meaningful data. It is designed to

          be used with the `navigator.sendBeacon` API in browsers to mark things

          such as how far down a thread a member has read, or whether or not a

          Library Page has been visited recently. It may queue the work for
          later

          processing and is not guaranteed to be processed immediately or at
          all.
