title: Datagraph Matches
description: |
  Query the datagraph optimised for typeahead scenarios. This endpoint is
  only active when a `SEARCH_PROVIDER` that supports fast access is used.
  This includes providers such as Bleve and Redis.

  This endpoint will return a minified set of results directly from the
  configured search index, without hitting the database. This makes it
  suitable for performance sensitive use-cases such as type-ahead search,
  @ mentioning threads/pages, CTRL+K style menus, and more.

  Results will include a `kind` field and short content, but will not
  contain graph edges (such as authorship, links, etc.) due to constraints
  of the underlying search index and to keep payload sizes smaller.
