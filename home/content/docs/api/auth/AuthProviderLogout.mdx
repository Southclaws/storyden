title: Auth Provider Logout
description: |
  Performs a HTTP logout by clearing the session cookie and redirecting to
  to the requested path at the frontend's `WEB_ADDRESS`. Typically this
  may be a secondary logout route on the frontend implementation that can
  handle any frontend-specific logout tasks. This is necessary in cases
  where the frontend is running on a different origin to the API service
  such as api.site.com vs site.com because Clear-Site-Data and other
  headers are same-origin compliant and won't work cross-origin.
