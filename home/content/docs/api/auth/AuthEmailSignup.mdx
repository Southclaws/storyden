title: Auth Email Signup
description: |
  Register a new account with an email and optional password. The password
  requirement is dependent on how the instance is configured for account
  authentication with email addresses (password vs magic link.)

  When the email address has not been registered, this endpoint will send
  a verification email however it will also return a session cookie to
  facilitate pre-verification usage of the platform. If the email address
  already exists, no session cookie will be returned in order to prevent
  arbitrary account control by a malicious actor. In this case, the email
  will be sent again with the same OTP for the case where the user has
  cleared their cookies or switched device but hasn't yet verified due to
  missing the email or a delivery failure. In this sense, the endpoint can
  act as a "resend verification email" operation as well as registration.

  In the first case, a 200 response is provided with the session cookie,
  in the second case, a 422 response is provided without a session cookie.

  Given that this is an unauthenticated endpoint that triggers an email to
  be sent to any public address, it MUST be heavily rate limited.
