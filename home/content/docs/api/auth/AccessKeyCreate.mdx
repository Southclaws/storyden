title: Access Key Create
description: |
  Create a new access key for the authenticated account. Access keys are
  used to authenticate API requests on behalf of the account in a more
  granular and service-friendly way than a session cookie.

  Access keys share the same roles and permissions as the owning account
  and only provide a way to use an `Authorization` header as an way of
  interacting with the Storyden API.

  Access keys also allow an expiry date to be set to limit how long a key
  can be used to authenticate against the API.
