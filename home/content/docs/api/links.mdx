        heading: link-list
      - content: >
          Add a link to the community bookmarks. This will also scrape the
          content

          at the site the link points to, if possible. If the submitted link is
          an

          invalid link for whatever reason (invalid URL structure or page is
          dead)

          then the API will fail. The metadata for the link is indexed on
          success.


          If the submitted link already exists it will be an idempotent
          operation,

          unless the body contains additional metadata. In these cases, the
          link's

          metadata will be updated with the new metadata and the URL is
          unchanged.


          When a link is submitted, it is first "cleaned" to remove any
          fragments.
        heading: link-create
      - content: |
          Get the details for a specific link. Such as where it's been posted,
          which resources it's linked to and how many times it's been opened.
