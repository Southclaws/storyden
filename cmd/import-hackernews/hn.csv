Ask HN: What business domain needs SMS/USSD based UI the most?,,"Hello HN,<p>Last few years I have been developing SMS (binary SMS)-as-a-Service applications, in python and java eco stack, where I&#x27;ve learned the internals of SMS (3GPP TS 23.040) and SIM cards security(3GPP TS 23.048).<p>Now I&#x27;ve allocated 30% of my work week to work on something new, something challenging on my own by mixing this hard earned knowledge with other different domain. According to technology radar 2013 (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thoughtworks.com&#x2F;radar), there is a need for SMS&#x2F;USSD UI for applications. Problem is that its very hard to choose a domain where I can apply SMS&#x2F;SIM knowledge.<p>I need a different perspective from you guys. Please do share your different views of applying it.

Who's fact checking the fact checkers – a case in point re Covid,,"Here&#x27;s is a breakdown of some of the issues that are claimed to be fraud relating to covid 19:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;off-guardian.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;covid19-evidence-of-global-fraud&#x2F;<p>And here is a fact check of fraud claims by USAToday found as FALSE:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eu.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;08&#x2F;fact-check-post-claiming-covid-19-fraud-offers-no-evidence&#x2F;3481311001&#x2F;<p>Regardless of the claims, what is the fact checking process?<p>Firstly, if you read through the &#x27;Fact Check&#x27; you will see this is NOT rigorous.  USAToday  state the claim, and then provide a official response to counter it.  But the official response is what is being brought into question!  It&#x27;s literally accepting the final word from the defendant.<p>Secondly, USAToday chooses a poor example of the &#x27;fraud claims&#x27; info on Facebook to debunk.  Because of that, it can say that there is no info as to how there is fraud on the tests, that the author didn&#x27;t respond to requests, etc.  So, the fact check article does not even need to address the fraud claims.<p>By purposely selecting poor material, USAToday do not need to look into any fraud details.  The can say &#x27;no fraud&#x27; without explaining why.<p>But even so, this so called &#x27;Independent Fact Check&#x27; is then used by Facebook, and presumably others, in order to warn people off the content.<p>Frankly, the process is a shambles.  Information is presented to Facebook that questions the official story.  Facebook ask a media expert (USAToday) to fact-check it.  USAToday ask the officials who are being accused in the information for the final word.  The information is labelled as FALSE.<p>This is a closed loop, and has nothing to do with getting to the truth.<p>As Orwell said in 1984:  &quot;Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.&quot;",,feralimal,1,1606731802,2020-11-30 10:23:22.000000 UTC,story,25252386,,7,,

Android mobile computing Short Answer,,"1.    Explain the concept of Cloud to Device Messaging. What are its limitations? 
Cloud to Device Messaging (C2DM) is a technology that connects mobile platform with cloud computing. The main idea is to enable cloud to contact mobile application without requiring custom polling mechanism. C2DM provides an easier platform within mobile applications that allow synchronization of data with the server. C2DM supports Google applications such as Gmail, Contacts, and Calendar. The c2dm system deals with sending of short messages that notify the mobile application about the existence of new updates that can be downloaded from the server. Using C2DM involves application registering a mobile device by signing in using their existing Google account. C2DM services generate an ID. The ID is sent to server which uses it to send short messages to target device
Limitations 
1.    C2DM system is not designed to handle a large amount of data it can only send 1024 bytes with a maximum of 200000 messages per day.
2.    Lack of support class library such as help to deal with registration ID
3.    Java API has low-level abstractions making it unfriendly for developers

Ask HN: Anyone Going to Food Hackathon and Forum This Weekend in SF?,,"	Anyone interested in food and hacking?
Food Hackathon &amp; Forum is happening this weekend in San Francisco Feb 27 thru March 1, and I&#x27;m looking to form a team before the weekend actually starts. Details at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;foodhackathon.co. The theme and challenge is Nutrition for All. The grand prize is a team trip to Milan, Italy for World Expo this summer.<p>I am journeying from Lake Tahoe with a pretty cool idea and a marketable unused .com to create something unique and hopefully win. At least put on a good show.<p>Seeing if anyone is interesting in attending and possibly forming a team before the event. I&#x27;ve done a couple of these before, winning money and prizes in the last one, but team building seemed to be the challenge vs. building something cool.<p>Teams can have up to five. Ideally two coders, one UX and maybe another wildcard. Personally I&#x27;ve been an owner in foodservice, consulted for many, and years of sales &amp; mktg in digital food mar, so I have a decent taste for the market. I currently work in food in Squaw Valley and have a system along with the connections set up to turn any MVP into a working situation.<p>Food is really hot right now and personally I&#x27;d like to win this and continue to build the project, take it to an accelerator and see where it goes.<p>Would love to find cool, smart people who love food and its possibilities, to build a team. Bonus points if you have a couch or spot on your floor to crash instead of the hostel.<p>Thanks for considering.

Mughal-E-Azam Plus Capsule,,"If a person discharges very early at the time of sexual play, it is called ‘Premature Ejaculation’. It would be true to say that sexual capacity varies from person to person. It can be from two minutes to ten minutes. If one ejaculated before the wife is fully satisfied, it should be deemed that he is suffering from ‘Premature Ejaculation’. There are many symptoms to know whether a person is suffering from this disease or not. For instance, to ejaculate at the very start of sexual act, to feel immediately excited when a person is besides a woman, to ejaculate at the very touch of private parts, or to discharge when a person gets a touch of women in the crowed. All these symptoms denote ‘Premature Ejaculation’, which may ultimately lead to impotency. That person who is suffering from ‘Premature Ejaculation’ should not take opium and other intoxicants for enjoyment. Undoubtedly, these intoxicants are of momentary use, but after some time he gets addicted and every time he has to take these intoxicants. In the long run these do not work and he becomes Impotent forever. A person who has done masturbation in excess may suffer from ‘Premature Ejaculation’.",true,herbal003,1,1562256913,2019-07-04 16:15:13.000000 UTC,story,20355739,,,,

UPPING CREDIT,,"Hi everyone, I’m Katia, a single mum from Oklahoma, I can&#x27;t believe that I became a victim of some pretty damn good credit again. Wow, it&#x27;s hard to think that this happens so fast. This company moved fast and started knocking off negative items on my credit report within 9days. 
Four years ago my score was over 780, and I was able to get my way with car rates, credits cards, and even buying my house at 4% rate. I can tell you it&#x27;s not the same with a 540 score. I try refinancing my home, and well I got the services of a person with poor credit. Not their fault but it was my own doing. I got myself into this unfortunate position. I call Lexington Law thinking this was my ticket out. But I quickly realize this place was a big NO NO!!!  They are like wolfs looking for sheep. But I didn&#x27;t be that sheep. I decided to stay local meanly because if you’re forking over any money for this kind of service you might want to be able to walk into the office if things get ugly. 
I texted HACKWEST through +1 424 307 2638 and also emailed HACKWEST@WRITEME.COM and pretty much this company solved just about all my worries. My score in January 2018 was 540. Today June 2018 is a full 200+ points up! Yes, that means today my score is over 740 and get this, it’s still going up! HACKWEST removed just about everything that was bad with my credit report. I can&#x27;t thank them for the headaches I will now avoid in my life. My credit will not only open the doors to make the big purchases, but I will be saving more money now than what I paid to HackWest! Yes, think about that and let it sink in! I&#x27;m not going to lose cash but save more money by paying them to fix my credit score and report!  
Overall I want to thank the whole company for setting up my credit report to shine to all the banks that are now willing to lend me money at a low rate! I can&#x27;t name one person because they all worked as a team and are recognized for the effort they put into fixing my credit. Thank you HackWest!!!!",true,katia8,1,1528929442,2018-06-13 22:37:22.000000 UTC,story,17307591,,,,

Create your identity in this world,,"The world is filled with men and women. But not all who make a living have an identity.<p>By identity, I don’t mean physical identities such as gender, color, race, or wealth. Identity is much more spiritual than that. A legacy which you leave behind, which acts as a torch that your future generation take forward.<p>Before proceeding further, take a moment and think about men or women who strike your mind and the identity you associate with them. Now can you reason out why “that men or women” struck your mind?<p>Let’s take some examples. When people think about Steve Jobs, they associate Apple with him. The calm and smiling face when Buddha strikes you. When you think about your mom, you associate the love and care she gives the family.<p>Now back to the question. “Why did that men or women struck your mind at your first thought”. Simply put, it’s because of the value they provided to the global community. This value helps the whole community move forward.<p>It’s no wonder that you always prefer buying stuff from that store&#x2F;business even though you might get it for a heavy discount elsewhere. The value they provide, the shopkeeper’s originality or the quality products, or the way they handle customer issues, gives them an identity in this world. It is for this reason you always prefer that store&#x2F;business.<p>So what if I said, these businesses independently could extend the same value which gave them their identity to the global community and make a greater impact.<p>If you are an entrepreneur, business owner, or homepreneur reading this, this is for you. The world needs more independent businesses. Take your business online with BubbleBiz and create an impact in this world.<p>“We know it’s not just a business, but your identity in this world.”<p>BubbleBiz - Take your business online and mark your presence in this world.<p>Check it out here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bubblebiz.in<p>I would love to hear your feedbacks.",true,vivek_0079,1,1604114320,2020-10-31 03:18:40.000000 UTC,story,24948897,,,,

Ask HN: Are any workstations secure?,,"With all of the discoveries in security breaches that have poured into the news over the last year, I came to wonder what or if anything is private anymore.

IN NEED OF a ETHICAL HACKER?,,"A friend of mine shared a testimony of him working with a ethical hacker he met online and how professional he is, so i told him to link me up with the hacker. Then i gave him a job to hack my cheating wife&#x27;s iphone because i noticed she was making secret calls and whenever i show up she ends the conversation. But unfortunately, after the hack was completed i discovered that the 8 months old baby i thought was mine was actually for another man she was still having an affair with. I&#x27;m sad but glad i found out about this at a very early stage before it got too late. This ethical hacker is the best at what he does. I also gave a friend his contact and he is currently helping him increase his credit score and remove eviction off his record.

I thought it was spam but I got more suspicious.<p>I then looked through his inbox and found nothing weird so I went to the sent box. There I saw 10 messages replying to craigslist ads in the personals section of the new state he moved to. They had a older private picture of himself and his new phone number attached saying &quot;up for some sexting fun&quot; etc.  I also looked through more in case, and saw some from June replying to 2 ads on Craigslist but in the state he was in before he moved, with the same private picture in the others. He claims he was hacked when I confronted him about it. I asked all the questions, why would someone take time to hack you and find your picture and phone number and put it on there.

BITS.4/4.txt,,"Can we combine them? Smashing two objects together often produces
interesting results, so lets give it a shot.  Here is a representation
of smashing bits together in every way possible, with ‘x’ here holding
a space for the distinct names we give to exactly how we are going to
smash them together.<p><pre><code>    0    x    0    =&gt;    ?
    0     x    1    =&gt;    ?
    1     x    0    =&gt;    ?
    1     x    1    =&gt;    ?
</code></pre>
Notice we are not necessarily commutatively smashing them in every
case, saying the 0 x 1 and 0 x 1 can be distinctly different.<p>Given that we only have 2 symbols to work with, the ‘?’ in the above
table can obviously only take one of those values.  So, using our
first intuition, let’s fill in the table:<p><pre><code>    0    x    0    =&gt;    0
    1    x    0    =&gt;    0
    0    x    1    =&gt;    0
    1    x    1    =&gt;    0
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    0    x    0    =&gt;    1
    1    x    0    =&gt;    1
    0    x    1    =&gt;    1
    1    x    1    =&gt;    1
</code></pre>
The first, bringing all combined values to 0 and the second bringing
them all to 1.  Not an incredibly interesting operation, but one
nonetheless, and now that we’ve found one, they should have names.<p><pre><code>    Floor - the floor of any two bits is 0

    0    _     0    =&gt;    0
    1    _    0    =&gt;    0
    0    _    1    =&gt;    0
    1    _    1    =&gt;    1

    Ceiling - the ceiling of any two bits is 1

    0    ^    0    =&gt;    0
    1    ^    1    =&gt;    1

Aptible Is Hiring Senior Platform Engineers,,"<i>Brooklyn&#x2F;Remote</i><p>We are looking for experienced software engineers to help build and maintain our deployment platform. The platform is built on top of Amazon Web Services and utilizes Docker to provide users with a sysops-free way to manage complex database and application architectures.<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence &amp; Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Relocation assistance, if you want to move to NYC.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f72d1f9/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;aptible&#x2F;e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f...</a>",,chasb,1,1427417339,2015-03-27 00:48:59.000000 UTC,job,9274173,,,,

Before we got started with the repair process, I was quite apprehensive about making an upfront payment and more importantly, giving out my personal info. On the contrary, I was wrong because the credit specialist deleted the few collections on my report, posted some fine lines of credit and eventually raised my score to 793.

How to Cope with Grief,,"Grief is one of the hardest emotional hurdles to get through, I say through because you have to walk it.  I won’t say to get over cause we never really get over losing a loved one. And we all grieve differently. With that in mind one of the important things to do is to reminisce with old photos, these intense feelings needs to be balanced with the happy memories. Allowing those good memories to fog your mind will usher in healing. Free flowing thoughts run through your mind letting the tears escape all part of the healing process. Remain firm in your emotions do not let them control you, let them run through you. Being in control means, your not totally falling apart, even as your world crumbles around you. Happiness will come again when fighting the loss ends. Start by bringing in the positive, yes it’s work on your part, learning to smile through the pain. Creating your own happiness. Rest assured the sun will come out again, and you will have gained wisdom through this heart breaking trial. makinglifeallbetter.wordpress.com",true,Better_Life,1,1476830948,2016-10-18 22:49:08.000000 UTC,story,12739410,,,,

Will Netflix be able to co-exist with new competitors? Quarterly Earning Tonight,,"Releases Q2 Report tonight. Article by Will Goad. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;willptgoad Hacker News wouldn&#x27;t let me have 4.5K characters so please read the rest on the link below. I intended to publish the full article here and I apologise for any inconvenience.
https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sipreadrepeat.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;17&#x2F;will-netflix-survive-and-co-exist-with-its-new-competition&#x2F;
In its 2019 Q1 quarterly financial report Netflix identified 2 upcoming competitors Disney+ and Apple TV+. Disney’s service will be the biggest threat due to Disney’s partial monopoly over the film world and now the TV world with it’s recent purchase of 21st century FOX. Apple will still be a threat simply because they are such a massive company so they will have more money to invest into shows however I believe they will be hindered by their lack of experience in the industry. Other competitors are also on the way including an upcoming streaming service from warner brothers.
Netflix’s biggest challenge will be the removal of shows from its platform for competitors to make them exclusive on their own platforms. According to a recent business insider article many of Netflix’s most popular shows over the last year which made up a 21% share of their episode views in 2018 could potentially be removed from the streaming service due to being owned by competitors. Netflix paid $100 million to keep friends on the site throughout 2019. Friends and The Office which together made up over 10% of Netflix views in 2018 will leave for Warner Media’s and NBC’s streaming services respectively by 2021.
The Netflix of 2018 would have likely failed in the long term. However, by the 3rd to 9th of July 2019 50% of the top 10 most watched shows in the UK are Netflix original shows including stranger things season 3 which 40.7 million viewers watched in the first 4 days breaking Netflix’s own record. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sipreadrepeat.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;17&#x2F;will-netflix-survive-and-co-exist-with-its-new-competition&#x2F;",,WillGoad,1,1563382178,2019-07-17 16:49:38.000000 UTC,story,20461458,,0,,

This is where we need your help on!<p>In this role you’ll be taking over services that comprise our Audience Builder product. You will have to dig into the dashboard codebase and make yourself (with our help ofc.) comfortable contributing before you will start to implement your first Audience Builder features and its integration independently.<p>Integration with third-parties like Facebook and Google is an important part of the Audience Builder and our dashboard backend. You will maintain existing and develop new API backends for a number of our services. Additionally, you’ll be contributing to our dashboard backend services that we are constantly improving and since almost every feature requires dashboard support it needs to be kept up to date.<p>You’ll face the challenge of building robust integrations with various third party APIs while keeping it simple and unified experience for our customers.

Too much long-form content on the web,,"Many pundits lament that twitter and other micro blogging services have created an &#x27;ADHD&#x27; environment where longer form content is being neglected, but I see an opposite trend of too much &#x27;long form&#x27; content, which is promoted using short-form content. So someone will tweet or post on a link on Reddit to one of many uneneding &#x27;long form&#x27; articles published by one of many popular sites such as Vox, Salon, etc. The problem is these huge articles are sometimes a chore to read, and you have to wade through pages of historical and philisophical preface before you get to the substance. It&#x27;s like there &#x27;s an article about American&#x27;s obcession with speed, but before I can get to the heart of the matter or the author&#x27;s personal take or solution, I first have to read through 500 years of history and what philosophers and historians thought of the issue. It&#x27;s like an infomercial where the host goes on about the problem that the trinket is supposed to solve and then in the last 5 minutes mentions the trinket. If something is unique and interesting there is no need to embellish it with 2000 words of introductory prose.

CMV: Form of Government Is a Rabbinical Theocratic Dictatorship (RTD),,"Where do I begin? Easy. There are lots of problems with current forms of government. Clearly Democracy is not working (see [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QFgcqB8-AxE] for a pretty short summary of why). Based on the IQ distribution, we have that 50% of people are below 100 IQ. If you go to a university or other decently high skill job, think about the dumbest person at that job. They probably have a 110+ IQ. Now consider that over 50% of people are dumber than that idiot who you hate with all your being. He is probably your boss, that project manager who wants you to play hopscotch with strangers as a team building exercise. Imagine if people just like him and even more stupid could singlehandedly decide on who the next ruler of your country will be. Terrible.<p>So clearly the next best option is to have the decision be made by a more intelligent group of people. Who better than Rabbis? They have studied all their lives, are genetically more likely to have a very high IQ, have shown immense dedication, work ethic, and pure intentions (aside from pricking the penis of male converts, not sure why they do that). It&#x27;s common for them to engage in debates and intellectual discussions with each other, and they are chosen by G-d as His favored people to lead the way forward for humanity.<p>Imagine a society where they are able to choose amongst themselves. Personally I think it would be amazing. The person they choose doesn&#x27;t even have to be a Rabbi or Jewish at all, it could be some random kid. But we need to all trust in their judgment because it is the best one available to us. To keep things fresh it&#x27;s probably best to rotate different Rabbis every year, maybe have one year be Conservative, the next one be Reform, etc. just for the variety and to give them a break. Many of them are senior citizens, we don&#x27;t want them getting exhausted or accelerating neurological issues they might have.",,aegooby,1,1650953922,2022-04-26 06:18:42.000000 UTC,story,31164563,,0,,

We have an ReSt API that have been in use internally &amp; now we have started opening it for our partners.<p>I have done the initial documentation by parsing our server logs to get the params, then tried the requests in POSTMAN.

the docs there are 90% correct but sometimes they are out-of-date, wrong or have grammatical&#x2F;typos in them which I fix but there is little bandwidth.

"What is PPIO and how is it different from IPFS, Storj and Sia?",,"PPIO is a programmable decentralized storage and delivery network. It not only provides more robust and eﬃcient services than existing cloud-based storage platforms such as AWS S3 but also signiﬁcantly reduces the storage cost. At the same time, PPIO also oﬀers better data security and privacy protection.
Storj is another project that has gone through years of development, but it remains in the testing phase. Some of the known issues of Storj are the lack of quick response from miners upon storage request and its transactions are settled once per month which is not friendly to the miners. BurstCoin utilizes Proof of Capacity (PoC) that does take storage capac-ity of the miners into account, but unfortunately, it is not enough to serve well for the storage requirements.<p>The emerging FileCoin project that is under development by Protocol Labs adds an incentive layer on top of Inter-planetary File System (IPFS), with the goal to build a storage infrastructure and protocol to replace HTTP protocol. For that purpose, its ﬁle index is made public to facilitate features like Web access, but it poses a challenge to preserving user privacy and data security in a storage network. Besides, some of its storage proofs are too complex and likely to hold the system back from running eﬃciently at a large scale.<p>It does borrow mature P2P system designs from proven applications such as BitTorrent, but it provides no good solution to handle complex network environments and does not oﬀer performance optimization within regional networks. Such deﬁciency in the design can lead to many real-world problems to the miners and ISPs. As Protocol Labs claims that ﬁles stored on IPFS are permanent and cannot be deleted, it runs the risks of legal battles against policies and regulations and makes its worldwide deployment much more diﬃcult.<p>PPIO white paper:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PPIO&#x2F;Whitepaper<p>PPIO Offical website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pp.io&#x2F;",,sdfj,1,1550201325,2019-02-15 03:28:45.000000 UTC,story,19168243,,0,,

Ask HN: Handling a dispute on Elance with an unrelenting client,,"I was awarded a job to work on Elance that involved Django. I gave an estimate of the cost &amp; schedule of 24 days and started working on the project immediately based on a word document that had specifications. Looks like the guy who awarded me the job was a recruiting agency guy who did it for his client.<p>Within a couple of days of starting work, I was told that the project deadline will be 11 days which was a significant reduction. So I asked for more money to complete more work in less time and delivered code for the first 3 milestones and asked for the client to verify the code and release payment for the same. The client did release the payment for the milestones and I started working on milestone 4 when I found out that my work is dependent on the work of another freelancer who was also contracted to work on the same project. The rate of discussing with the project lead and completing work was dismally slow and I was down with fever for 4 days while working on the project. And when I wanted to stop working on the project, I requested the same and was persuaded to go further. More details were added to the work and involved a lot of UI and jQuery stuff which I had 0 expertise. So I asked out and there was no response except that I had to complete the project. So I cancelled the job and they asked their money back. Initially I refused saying that it was for the code already delivered, but they were yammering on and on about how my code is useless to them unless I finish the project. Fed up with it, I offered to do full refund provided they sign an NDA that they will not use my code in any project and provide me a receipt for the payment.<p>But the guy went and raised a dispute on Elance, wants my account suspended alongwith the refund without providing NDA. Now it is in the Elance mediation stage. How should I handle this?

The Mona Lisa Thought Experiment,,"Imagine you are John Doe, an extremely wealthy art collector. You have just found out that the Louvre Museum has decided to auction off the Mona Lisa. There are two different ways this pans out in two parallel universes.<p>Case 1
Here, the painting is auctioned off in a standard way. You win the bid and you agree to pay $1 billion dollars to buy the Mona Lisa. Louvre hands over the original to you. You can now choose to do whatever you want with it.
In the place where the painting originally hanged, a plaque states that the painting has been sold off. It, however, makes no mention of your name.<p>Case 2
In this universe, a machine exists that can create exact replicas of products. It does it in such a way that the original and the duplicate are indistinguishable. For instance, if the Mona Lisa was duplicated with this machine, things contained in the original such as (for instance) Da Vinci’s fingerprints and DNA would be copied exactly onto the duplicate. In other words, it is scientifically impossible to determine the replica from the fake.
Louvre decides to create 100,000 copies of the Mona Lisa using this machine. Due to a mishap, the original gets mixed with the replicas. There is absolutely no way of knowing which is the original anymore.
Louvre now decides to conduct an auction. If you win, Louvre will put up a plaque stating that you, John Doe, are the original owner of the Mona Lisa. They will give you the option of taking one of the copies home. They will continue to hang a copy at the museum. And they will sell the remaining at their gift shop for $1 apiece.
We can never know if the original is hanging at the Louvre, was picked by you, or by someone at the gift store for a dollar. But a plaque will always exist at the Louvre stating that the original Mona Lisa belongs to John Doe, thus ascribing ownership to you.<p>I have 2 questions:
1. If you were willing to pay $1 billion in case 1, how much would you be willing to pay in case 2?
2. Why did you choose this amount? Why was it higher&#x2F;lower&#x2F;the same?",,rounakbanik,1,1628336700,2021-08-07 11:45:00.000000 UTC,story,28097824,,0,,

How do you handle user profiles when using multiple OAuth services?,,"I'm working on an example application which shows how to use OAuth to login users into a web application. This is fairly straight forward if only one OAuth provider is allowed, but it becomes complicated if an application needs to access multiple OAuth services.&#60;p&#62;For example, assume an application allows users to login with Twitter and/or Dropbox. The first time the user comes to the site, he logs in with Twitter and a profile is created with his Twitter screen name. The second time he comes to the site he logs in using Dropbox and a new profile is created, because there is no way to determine this is the same person who logged in previously. Now the user has two different profiles.&#60;p&#62;It is possible for the user to login with Twitter and then provide his Facebook credentials to the application, and for the app to determine the user now has two profiles, but should the system enable the user to combine those profiles at that point?

The Great Product Showdown Story,,"Keeping the Competitive Edge<p>What do you do when you have a disagreement amongst friends in a start-up?  You put your guru reputation on the line and you duel it out, coder brawl.  That’s how my co-founders and I decided to settle our little debate.  Here’s my story.<p>The Valley<p>Let’s start by painting the mental perspective of a typical developer here.  Living in Silicon Valley, is like living in a strange mix of science fiction meets old gold digging and wild west cowboys.  We don’t herd cows, but we do wrangle code.  We don’t dig for gold, but we do mine data.  There’s a wild and untamed sense that the mother-load of payouts could be sitting anywhere.  The environment supports this.  Everybody gets it.  Just down the street from my apartment is a community center for start-ups.  We’re talking about a communal working (and sleeping) area for those who has to burn the midnight oil for a chance at the dream.<p>So that’s the mentality.  Ideas are cheap, you prove it by doing it yourself.<p>Thing is, you’re not by your lonesome when you’re working in a start-up.  My posse and I have been working our claim to fame for a year now.  Our company, Appfluence (www.appfluence.com), have gradually built a rather loyal following to our product.  We recently added another line to our product called Priority Matrix suite and managed to make a lot of people happy by giving them the long awaited Mac version that they’ve been asking for.<p>Now what?<p>A while before we decided to make our Mac version,  we wanted to know: should we make a PC version?  Windows?  Web? Enterprise? VC? Suite? Android? We had a lot of questions!  Answers aren’t short here in Silicon Valley either.  There are many people that can tell you their experience, but how to make sense of the signals?  Some questions we had for the near-term included: is it possible to lower our price model to $0.99?  Is it better to diversify our product line by replicating our technology into other areas? Or do we stick with our current offering and continue to polish the user experience.  If so, how?<p>So we sat, and we thought about it.  Should we start pricing our software differently?  I admit it; I’m in the business so that I can make money.  Except that customers are expecting free, or freemium.  Let me just say this now.  The freemium model is damn hard to pull off.  Just trying to give something away for free is hard.  Spreading the word about yourself is hard.  People have high expectations for paid apps, but even higher expectations for free app.  Why? Because they expect it to be good and free, instead of just good.<p>So we’ve tried a few things, we at least have an idea of where the money is.  Or do we?  The good thing about having questions is at least you have ideas for things to look for.  The problem with having questions is actually finding the answers.<p>The few (limited) resources we had were ingenuity, and time.  We’re in it for the money, that’s the goal.<p>So I came up with an idea and presented it to the guys.  I proposed that we settle our questions by doing a business competition.  We would compete, internally.  The idea was simple.  We’d operate under our Appfluence flag and spend 1 month developing a product to test some questions.  It was a bigger version of A/B testing.  So we drew up some simple rules.<p>(http://www.appfluence.com/great_product_showdown)<p>Rules:<p>-Use any material resources you deem necessary<p>-1-month development, 30-days market measurement (from time of approval by Apple)<p>-30 days of free form marketing during the sales period
Only 20 hours of customer support (additional coding) is allowed after the development period<p>-Each hour beyond the 20 hours shall cost 1% of your point each<p>-In case of emergency, all parties will halt as agreed (determined by a polling panel)<p>-Withdrawal = automatic loss, still has to fulfil prize obligation<p>-No foul play<p>We used our the metrics from our other products to issue the scoring.  Our goal was to have each and everyone of us learn how a product gets to a consumer and why.  We understand it was difficult to do this while doing support and development for our flagship product at the same time, so we had to work it around our primary product.<p>After 1 month of development, this is my contest product:
Roger the Scapegoat (http://www.appfluence.com/roger_the_scapegoat)<p>Let’s see how it goes!  Please help me win this competition.  I really, really want the dinners and the bragging rights.  However this may turn out, I am optimistic that we will have a better idea of how to grow our business.  In a month, I will post the result of this little experiment on the product

In particular, his Builder Pattern (item 2) has had the greatest effect. I have gotten farther in the past couple of months since discovering this book and this pattern, than in my past decade of programming. Despite this, I am still finding myself hitting the same wall: Extending classes with self-returning method-chains is at best discouraging, and at worst a nightmare--especially when generics come into play, and especially with self-referential generics, such as Comparable&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt;. As a result, I have created what I call &quot;The Blind Builder&quot;, which is a replacement for the Bloch Builder, for a very specialized situation: for use in classes that are highly-reusable, and intended for extending and sub-extending many times over. Not to say in any way that this pattern is &quot;better&quot;, just that in this particular situation it does provide some advantages. The biggest is how it decouples the to-be-built class from its builder, allowing it to be extended without having to extend its builder. Another benefit is that, aside from a single character, The Blind Builder is used in exactly the same way as the Bloch Builder. This pattern is thoroughly documented, and is presented in a question-and-answer format.",,aliteralmind,1,1392665831,2014-02-17 19:37:11.000000 UTC,story,7253957,,0,,

I&#x27;m looking for a little bit of advice in regards
to my career.<p>About 2 years ago I was hired at a large media
company as a graphic designer. For the first four
months my job was designing online ads and doing
basic HTML&#x2F;CSS templating tasks. Easy peasy, no
problem there.<p>After the first few months my love of programming
and system administration was noticed and I began
mixing a bit of PHP and Ruby development into my
workflow. Again, no problem there.<p>Within a few months my entire job description had
changed. I no longer do <i>any</i> graphic design.
Literally <i>none</i>. I&#x27;m fine with that, it&#x27;s not my
passion anyway. But this point I&#x27;m managing two
Linux application servers (nginx, mySQL, PHP,
Ruby, etc), writing code 8 hours a day. Most
recently I&#x27;ve been joined development of a new
product using Ruby on Rails.<p>I admit I kind of let this happen, but I&#x27;m getting
increasingly frustrated. At this point, despite
doing the work of a full-time devmin, on paper I&#x27;m
still a designer with a very low designer&#x27;s wage
(approx 26k&#x2F;yr).<p>I&#x27;ve talked to management about this twice now,
once when I first started doing more programming
work (around 4 months after starting), and once
about a month ago (after nearly 2 years at the
company). Both times I requested the title of
&quot;programmer&quot; or &quot;sysadmin&quot; but both times I was
refused and given the excuse &quot;you&#x27;re growing into
the position.&quot;<p>See http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;raw.php?i=BiEMLwfw for the rest.",,klaatu,1,1371484330,2013-06-17 15:52:10.000000 UTC,story,5893868,,0,,

Is the ageism in my head?,,"I&#x27;ve been a product manager at bay area tech startups for 15 years and have been hacking since the 80s.  Only recently did I formerly learn how to code (about 3 years now, self taught on a daily basis and also via a well respected 3 month in-person training course) and have become fairly proficient at Ruby and Rails. I&#x27;ve met with about 30 companies in the past 6 months and haven&#x27;t even gotten close to getting an offer. I am a very smart, very capable person and am doing just fine on the technical questions.  I seem to connect with most people I interview with but have been passed over time and time again.  Most of the startups I meet with I met on Angel List and White Truffle.  Probably all of the people who I&#x27;ve interviewed with have been younger than me by at least 10 years (I&#x27;m 42).  I&#x27;ve never had a problem getting a job before as a product manager. Could it be ageism at play here?  It couldn&#x27;t possibly be my inexperience because I see so many other people with less experience getting jobs.  I know networking is important and have been doing that like crazy.  I&#x27;ve exhausted my old network.  Many of the people I speak with are surprised I switched from product management to development and tell me I should be in management by now.

They both create great value, and are both very appealing to me, but I have a thought that the consumer web sector is bit outdated now.<p>So I am having headache on which company to choose.

1) a place where I can apply my CS skill on, an opportunity to join a team to create great value
2) work that helps me improve, and lead me to my next goal (possibly join smaller start-up, or build my own start-up)

Except I feel as though I&#x27;m disconnected from the community because I&#x27;m only there when class is in session. I have some friends who were CS majors here, but opted out because the classes became too difficult. The clubs and social life at this university are also abysmal.

Whether it be programming related or life long friendships that other colleges always boast about, I just feel like I&#x27;m not getting those same opportunities that my facebook friends are getting at other colleges. I know to take those pictures and statuses with a grain of salt, but when I look at myself, I haven&#x27;t been apart of anything.

Ask HN: Healthcare Startup - Is this the venue?,,"I work for a healthcare MCO which is focused on the Medicaid and Medicare population. Over the last year or so faced with rapidly rising medical costs in our member population we launched a coordination of benefits(COB) cost management initiative aimed at identifying members who may have other health insurance while covered by us. In the health insurance world Medicaid should ALWAYS be the payer of last resort and if a member has other health insurance Medicaid should never pay the bill.<p>I was able to develop a fairly straightforward two-step utility to 1) identify members who have other health insurance and 2) identify what if any claims our MCO paid for those members. I ran this process across our population and the numbers were staggering... showing tens of millions of dollars that we could potentially recoup...and are now starting to recoup from providers who routed those claims erroneously to us.<p>Given that coordination of benefits (COB) is a core function with significant opportunity  but where there is little automation I decided to launch a start up to drive this as a cost management or profit initiative where technology would play a key role in addressing the problem. My research shows that poorly managed COB function is costing hundreds of millions of dollars across the entire population of insured so the opportunity and ROI to clients would be significant.<p>So I'm basically looking for persons to partner with on this effort - strategic advisors, developers etc. While I have a developer background I have long graduated from coding and my focus is more on strategy and analytics. I know healthcare is not 'sexy' and this is not some shiny new social mashup but it is a big problem and the opportunity is significant.Your feedback is appreciated - it is a bit lonely in the health startup world - and if anyone wants to go deeper with this you can email me at: techy4health@gmail.com.",,Sol2Sol,1,1318396091,2011-10-12 05:08:11.000000 UTC,story,3101584,,2,,

Want to do a startup with bootstrapping!,http://geniteam.com,"Want to do a startup with bootstrapping!&#60;p&#62;By Khurram Samad: Founder &#38; CEO GeniTeam&#60;p&#62;The write up is based on my personal experience and learning while working with serial entrepreneurs. After having helped various startups, I launched GeniTeam in 2006 to provide dedicated software engineers to help entrepreneurs develop products with bootstrapping. Over the years, my own startup has gained momentum and helping promising startups based in North America, Netherland and Israel. &#60;p&#62;GeniTeam Business Model:-
Many people come across innovative idea but fail to materialize it for lack of resources. The barriers for high tech startup are high for huge upfront investment requirement. Hence, many people seek funding from venture capitalists, by giving up significant amount of equity or give up idea for lack of access to funding. GeniTeam provides an alternate to such entrepreneurs by allowing them hire virtual team members with GeniTeam, at fraction of cost to help entrepreneurs materialize their dreams. The dedicated virtual team members are hosted with GeniTeam in Lahore, Pakistan and whose growth is linked to growth of startup. The time difference allows entrepreneurs to monitor and instruct virtual team members in evening and generating cash flows for startup by doing consulting or job in day time. &#60;p&#62;How my faith strengthened on business model:-
The company's business model has evolved out of my personal consulting for CambridgeDocs, an XML conversion company. I worked single handed from my home in Pakistan, to help the startup expand its product line. During my consulting, I refined ""virtual team"" model and build the confidence to expand virtual team in Pakistan. After 6-8 month of successful work, the company decided to start its offshore operation in Lahore, Pakistan. This strengthened my faith on my business model, as most of the engineers working with CambridgeDocs were graduates of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. After establishing and training initial resources for offshore office, I started helping multiple companies. Over last 3 years, I have refined the processes for virtual team and created few more success stories.&#60;p&#62;Does GeniTeam take Equity:-
We only take equity if we invest with the startup. Our resource cost is pretty nominal, and hence startup's generally don't need to share equity. The partnering startups are free to change vendor or quit us, if they wish. They also have an option of acquiring virtual team to own the startup team. &#60;p&#62;Then how does GeniTeam make money:-
GeniTeam primary cash flows are through product development. GeniTeam is working on ""Team Room"", ""Multiplayer Mobile Games over GPRS"", and online tutoring application, developed in rich internet applications. In future, GeniTeam would like to help startups refine ideas and develop marketing plans.&#60;p&#62;Is GeniTeam a traditional outsourcing company?
Our philosophy is radically different from traditional outsourcing companies. GeniTeam believes in building partnerships with startups, and growing with them. GeniTeam is serving niche high tech startup segment, not catered by traditional outsourcing companies. Distinguished by vision, our model allows partnering companies build and retain expertise X as they could do by hiring resource with them. &#60;p&#62;How can people manage people from 10000 miles away?
This is the most frequent question I hear on sales. I believe internet has revolutionized our lives, and also the work environments. With such changes, virtual team and virtual office have become reality. However, the processes to manage virtual team are slightly different and require enhanced communication and reporting techniques. It requires almost 1 to 2 months, to fully reap the benefits of virtual team. I personally believe, it really worth investing time and few bucks in idea.&#60;p&#62;

Ask HN: how to reach teenagers with a social network?,,"Hi HN,<p>As far as I know, the easiest audience to reach by social networks, and subsequently the first audience which is reached, is 20/30-somethings. Facebook would be a bad example as it was first pitched at college students, but look at other examples: only recently Twitter started to be popular among teenagers. (At least in the countries I've lived in in Europe: 1 or 2 years ago no teenager would use it, I now see more and more teenagers on it.) Foursquare is still the domain of 20-somethings, just like Gowalla, or Reddit, which potentially could be interesting for 15/16/17-year olds as well.<p>How come? Is it because teenagers are not really interested in new social networks, they just want to be where their friends are? Or is it because social networks aren't pitched at them?

Ask HN: Any caveats with publishing business plans while looking for investors?,,"Hey HN, looking for some advice or insight from others.

New Standards for Preventing Browser Hijacking,,"There’s a long history of attackers compromising popular web destinations, and exploiting those resources for monetary gain – the user populations are sometimes more valuable than the data on the compromised service.<p>Placing ‘exploit kits’ on compromised pages, and hitting their users’ with browser exploits or downloads continues to be popular, as is conducting ad-fraud. Cryptocurrency mining is yet another vector for attackers to monetize their hacks.<p>The problem is this; how does a browser verify that the code it has received from a website – is the same code the organization released to production?<p>The use of secure HTTPS communications – over TLS and SSL – prevents some attackers, such as those carrying out man-in-the-middle attacks from malicious wireless access points, or your local network. However, there’s a much larger attack surface upstream of HTTPS protections, Load Balancers, upstream enterprise components (an explosion with microservices trends), and the application servers themselves. Any of these components present a pivot point for attackers looking to exploit customers – because they can all introduce code before those connections are protected over the wire with HTTPS.<p>What we could use is an addition to web-standards, one that allows organizations to produce verifiable client-code, and browsers to validate that code. Long term, the dynamic aspects of JavaScript and modern development practices – such as manipulation of the Document Object Model at runtime – via WebSockets, Web Messages, contents of state in LocalStorage, and Ajax calls, mean that these efforts need to rely on a subset of JavaScript, safe from unintended injection attacks.

Meanwhile, Microsoft&#x2F;Google have talented engineers and great culture with excellent pay, perks, and benefits as well as a strong learning environment and a manageable workload.

Cara Mengobati Asam Urat,http://www.trica-jus.name/cara-mengobati-asam-urat/,"Cara Mengobati Asam Urat dengan Ace maxs merupakan solusi terbaik dalam pengobatan tradisional asam urat, karena dalam khasiat Ace maxs terdapat kulit manggis dan daun sirsak yang memiliki banyak kandungan zat antioksidan yang sangat berperan dalam pengobatan asam urat. Cara Mengobati Asam Urat dengan Ace maxs memang menjadi pilihan yang tepat. Walupun ace maxs di bilang obat tradisional, tetapi obat ace maxs ini diproses dengan sangat modern, dan pengolahannya pun di dukung dengan teknologi canggih, hal ini dibuktikan karena demi menjaga keaslian mutu dan bahan baku yang terkandung dalam komposisi tersebut.<p>Obat Tradisional Ace Maxs yang terbuat dari kulit manggis dan daun sirsak dapat mengobati asam urat dengan tuntas dan aman, mengapa? Ini karena kandungan berbagai senyawa yang ada di dalamnya. Kulit manggis yang menghasilkan warna merah keunguan, dan amat sulit dibersihkan. Karena mengandung tanin, resin, dan crystallizable mangostine (C20H22O5), yang mudah larut dalam alkohol atau ether, tidak larut dalam air. Kulit manggis amat berkhasiat untuk membuang asam urat di dalam tubuh. Selain itu kandungan xanthone di dalam kulit manggis memiliki sifat sebagai antiperadangan dan bisa meredakan nyeri.
Kandungan senyawa tannin, fitosterol, caoksalat, dan alkaloid murisine dalam daun sirsak dipercaya mampu mengatasi asam urat.

Acai Berry Remove toxic sludge from your colon,http://ancientweightloss.blogspot.com,"Have you seen the advertisements for products featuring acai berry, one of nature's super foods?  In case you haven't heard, news of Acai Berry has been sweeping across the country. Rated the #1 ""super food"" by doctors across America, it has 10 times the antioxidant power of red grapes plus vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids..Everyone seems to be talking about it these days. ""America's Doctor"" added acai berry to his ""Ultimate Checklist For Great Aging."" Plus, it's been featured on NBC's The Today Show, The Wall Street Journal, and more. GNS (Global Nutrition Sciences), one of America's most trusted supplement companies, wants to make you aware that most, if not all, of the acai products  you have seen are not what they appear to be.Using pictures of the acai berry, they claim to help you ""flush away the pounds,"" yet many of these products contain little to no real acai. You're not going to get the antioxidant and cleansing benefits of this rainforest wonder.Some of the products don't even let you see the label before you try them! It's no wonder... many are simply packed with cornstarch or other worthless filler.At GNS, they believe in honesty and producing a quality supplement that they can stand behind proudly.That's why they have created Acai Berry Edge, a new cleansing formula that includes 250 mg of high-quality acai berry extract in every serving. This proprietary blend of cleansing herbs and nutrients is scientifically designed to reduce gas and bloating while cleansing your digestive tract of excess waste and water weight.You could have pounds and pounds of excess waste clogging your system and giving you a permanently bloated appearance... why put up with it any longer? Now you can get a 30-day supply of Acai Berry Edge to try for yourself.Participation is being limited, so you must act now to ensure your place.",true,quantay71,1,1241670358,2009-05-07 04:25:58.000000 UTC,story,597411,,-1,,

Cara Menyembuhkan Glaukoma,http://obatacemaxs.biz/cara-menyembuhkan-glaukoma/,"Cara Menyembuhkan Glaukoma
Glaukoma adalah salah satu jenis penyakit mata dengan gejala yang tidak langsung, yang secara bertahap menyebabkan penglihatan pandangan mata semakin lama akan semakin berkurang sehingga akhirnya mata akan menjadi buta. Hal ini disebabkan karena saluran cairan yang keluar dari bola mata terhambat sehingga bola mata akan membesar dan bola mata akan menekan saraf mata yang berada di belakang bola mata yang akhirnya saraf mata tidak mendapatkan aliran darah sehingga saraf mata akan mati.<p>Glaukoma bisa menyerang siapa saja. Deteksi dan penanganan dini adalah jalan satu-satunya untuk menghindari kerusakan penglihatan serius akibat glaukoma. Bagi Anda yang berisiko tinggi disarankan untuk memeriksakan mata Anda secara teratur sejak usia 35 tahun. Faktor risiko:<p>1.  Riwayat glaukoma di dalam keluarga.
2.  Tekanan bola mata tinggi
3.  Miopia (rabun jauh)
4.  Diabetes (kencing manis)
5.  Hipertensi (tekanan darah tinggi)
6.  Migrain atau penyempitan pembuluh darah otak (sirkulasi buruk)
7.  Kecelakaan/operasi pada mata sebelumnya
8.  Menggunakan steroid (cortisone) dalam jangka waktu lama
9.  Lebih dari 45 tahun<p>Apabila Anda punya salah satu atau beberapa ciri seperti yang kami sebutkan di atas, maka Anda punya ""bakat"" untuk menderita glaukoma.
