/**
 * Processes a raw string input to create a slug suitable for use as a Mark. It
 * is designed to be used with an <input> value prop, allowing the typing state
 * to continue in a flowing way while outputting possibly invalid slugs.
 *
 * Invalid slugs are still stored in state, they are still processed partially
 * in order to allow the user to type "my-page" by not stripping the trailing
 * hyphen when they are at the "my-" stage of typing. Even though this will be
 * rejected by the API, the pre-patch function further processes the value by
 * removing the trailing hyphen, so that the user can continue typing easily.
 *
 * @param raw raw string input to be processed into a slug from an input box.
 * @returns the partially well-formed slug, spaces replaced by hyphens, multiple
 *          hyphens collapsed into one, disallowed characters removed, and
 *          converted to lowercase.
