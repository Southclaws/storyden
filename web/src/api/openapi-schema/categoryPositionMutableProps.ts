 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.
