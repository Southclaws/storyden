 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

/**
 * A tag fill-rule defines a strategy for automatically generating a set of
tags for a datagraph item using semantic/LLM features. Using `query` as
a rule will not modify the resource but return the tags as part of the
response for the frontend implementation to present to the user as a set
of suggestions. Using `replace` as a rule will automatically update the
tags of the affected resource with those sourced by the semdex LLM.
