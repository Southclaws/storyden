 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

/**
 * Mutating property schemas permits updating existing fields as well as
adding new fields. The discinction is determined by the presence of the
`id` field. When an `id` field is provided, the operation is treated as
an update operation where any of the other fields will be used to write
new values. If an `id` field is omitted, the schema is considered a new
field and is subject to a uniqueness constraint on the `name` field.
