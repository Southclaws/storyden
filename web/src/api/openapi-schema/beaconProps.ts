 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

 * A beacon is a lightweight reference to an object used for tracking
purposes. It contains only the kind and ID of the object. This is mostly
used for tracking read states of threads. But may be used for more.

I should clarify, not the morally questionable kind of "tracking".
