 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

/**
 * A supervised plugin is a plugin that is managed and hosted by the 
Storyden runtime itself. The URL points to the plugin's source file
which the runtime will read, verify and then host itself for the plugin
process to connect to.

This is identical to uploading a plugin directly via binary file, the
only difference is it's fetched from a URL rather than uploaded.
