 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

 * The state of the plugin, whether it is active, inactive, starting or in
an error state. When plugins are added, they are initially inactive and
must be activated before being used. When activating, the plugin
transitions through the "starting" state while the process starts and
connects. An active plugin can be deactivated or if it crashes or
encounters an error, it will be set to the "restarting" state and a
restart will be attempted. If this succeeds, it will transition back to
"active", but if it fails again it will transition to the "error" state.
