 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

 * Where to yield fill results from. When set to `url` the link
will be fetched first and the content will be used to fill the target.
When set to `content` the content of the resource will be used. If used
on a patch request, fill rules will use any parameters in the patch over
existing current data in the resource. Otherwise it'll use the resource.

Data filling occurs in a specific order: summary, title and tags. This
means that if you set a content fill rule to summarise content, then the
output of that summarisation is used to generate the title and tags.
