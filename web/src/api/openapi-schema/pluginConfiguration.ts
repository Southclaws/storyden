 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

 * The plugin's configuration as defined by the plugin itself. This is a
free-form object that the plugin can define and use for its own purposes.
The Storyden runtime does not interpret or modify this data in any way,
but simply stores it and provides it to the plugin when requested.

This is not part of the plugin manifest and is not required to be
provided when adding a plugin, but can be set and updated separately
after the plugin is added. This allows for dynamic configuration of
plugins without needing to modify their manifest or re-add them.
