 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

/**
 * The plugin's manifest information read from the plugin itself. This 
describes the version information, the author, its requested access and
other information that the plugin has provided.

This data structure is direct from the plugin itself and is not modified
by the runtime. As such, it's not part of the Storyden HTTP API contract
so it's left as a free-form object here so that HTTP clients don't rely
on its structure here. That being said, the manifest format is defined
in a contract as part of the Plugin RPC spec which is a separate spec.

As a HTTP API consumer, you probably won't need to interact with this in
such a way that requires validation, however if you do need the schema,
it is located in `plugin.yaml` in the same folder as this specification.
