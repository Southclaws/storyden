 * Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.
The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

/**
 * A polymorphic identifier which is either a raw ID, a slug or both values
combined and separated by a hyphen. This allows endpoints to respond to
varying forms of a resource's ID which may be present in different app
contexts. For example, a slug may be used in a URL but raw IDs are often
exposed as part of API responses or in certain endpoint parameters. This
type allows flexibility in user experience as well as the API surface
while ensuring performance during database queries and other operations.

For example, given a thread with the ID `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50` and the
slug `top-10-movies-thread`, Storyden will understand both the forms:
`cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50-top-10-movies-thread` or `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50` or
`top-10-movies-thread` as the identifier for that thread.

Marks are only ever used on the read path as they are a derivative data
type and are not stored in the database as-is, while IDs and slugs are.
The write path typically exposes slugs as writable and IDs as immutable.
