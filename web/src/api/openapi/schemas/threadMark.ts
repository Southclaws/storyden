 * A thread's ID and optional slug separated by a dash = it's unique mark.
This allows endpoints to respond to varying forms of a thread's ID.

For example, given a thread with the ID `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50` and the
slug `top-10-movies-thread`, Storyden will understand both the forms:
`cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50-top-10-movies-thread` and `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50`
 as the identifier for that thread.
