 * An item is an arbitrary object used for indexing any kind of structured
data for the purposes of archival, search, documentation, products, etc.
Items are similar to posts in terms of data model but are semantically
different when it comes to purpose.

If you were to use Storyden to run a community for a video game for
example, items could be used to represent actual items from the game
which allows members to search for them as  well as reference them in
posts and other content.
