// Package bindings is responsible for providing a bridge between the code that
// is generated from the OpenAPI specification that comprises the "Transport"
// layer and the code that implements the product, or the "Service" layer.
//
// This package is structured as a set of structs which are compose together in
// the struct called `Bindings` which implements an interface generated by the
// oapi-codegen tool which describes all the endpoints.
//
// Aside from `bindings.go`, pretty much every Go file is named after a REST
// collection from the OpenAPI specification.
//
// ## Adding Routes
//
// To add a new route, you first modify the OpenAPI specification YAML document
// and then run the `generate` task which generates all the handler declarations
// and types necessary to implement the binding.
//
// Next, you create a file in this package named after the collection. So if you
// added `/things/{id}` you'd create `things.go` and inside that file, a struct
// named `Things` and a constructor named `NewThings`. This pattern may not need
// to apply for certain cases but it's generally best to try to follow for most.
//
// You then add your struct to the `Bindings` composed struct and provide the
// implementation of your struct to the DI system using `bindingsProviders`.
//
// ## Changing Routes
//
// Updating a route is as simple as just modifying the OpenAPI specification
// and making the necessary changes to the bindings to get the code compiling.

//
// When you edit `openapi.yaml` and re-run the code generation task, this will
// most likely change the declaration of `StrictServerInterface` inside the
// generated package `openapi`.
//
// The error you will see is most likely something along the lines of:
//
//	*Bindings does not implement openapi.StrictServerInterface
//
// and the underlying problem is either missing methods or methods that have
// changed signature due to changes to the parameters or request or response.
//
// This API follows RESTful design so a collection in the API specification
// (such as `/accounts`) will map to a file, struct and constructor here (such
// as `accounts.go`, `Accounts` and `NewAccounts`) and everything is glued
// together in this file.
