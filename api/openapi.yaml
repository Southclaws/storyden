        Add a link to the community bookmarks. This will also scrape the content
        at the site the link points to, if possible. If the submitted link is an
        invalid link for whatever reason (invalid URL structure or page is dead)
        then the API will fail. The metadata for the link is indexed on success.

        If the submitted link already exists it will be an idempotent operation,
        unless the body contains additional metadata. In these cases, the link's
        metadata will be updated with the new metadata and the URL is unchanged.

        When a link is submitted, it is first "cleaned" to remove any fragments.

    ThreadMark:

        A thread's ID and optional slug separated by a dash = it's unique mark.
        This allows endpoints to respond to varying forms of a thread's ID.

        For example, given a thread with the ID `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50` and the
        slug `top-10-movies-thread`, Storyden will understand both the forms:
        `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50-top-10-movies-thread` and `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50`
         as the identifier for that thread.

    Cluster:
      description: |
        A cluster is a group of items and other clusters. It serves as an 
        abstraction for grouping structured data objects. It can represent
        things such as brands, manufacturers, authors, directors, etc. Clusters
        can be referenced in content posts and they also have their own content.

    Item:
      description: |
        An item is an arbitrary object used for indexing any kind of structured
        data for the purposes of archival, search, documentation, products, etc.
        Items are similar to posts in terms of data model but are semantically
        different when it comes to purpose.

        If you were to use Storyden to run a community for a video game for
        example, items could be used to represent actual items from the game
        which allows members to search for them as  well as reference them in
        posts and other content.
