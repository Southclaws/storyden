    Storyden social API for building community driven platforms.

    The Storyden API does not adhere to semantic versioning but instead applies
    a rolling strategy with deprecations and minimal breaking changes. This has
    been done mainly for a simpler development process and it may be changed to
    a more fixed versioning strategy in the future. Ultimately, the primary way
    Storyden tracks versions is dates, there are no set release tags currently.

    post:
      operationId: AuthEmailSignup
      description: |
        Register a new account with an email and optional password. The password
        requirement is dependent on how the instance is configured for account
        authentication with email addresses (password vs magic link.)

        When the email address has not been registered, this endpoint will send
        a verification email however it will also return a session cookie to
        facilitate pre-verification usage of the platform. If the email address
        already exists, no session cookie will be returned in order to prevent
        arbitrary account control by a malicious actor. In this case, the email
        will be sent again with the same OTP for the case where the user has
        cleared their cookies or switched device but hasn't yet verified due to
        missing the email or a delivery failure. In this sense, the endpoint can
        act as a "resend verification email" operation as well as registration.

        In the first case, a 200 response is provided with the session cookie,
        in the second case, a 422 response is provided without a session cookie.

        Given that this is an unauthenticated endpoint that triggers an email to
        be sent to any public address, it MUST be heavily rate limited.

        invalid link for whatever reason (invalid URL structure or page is dead)
        then the API will fail. The metadata for the link is indexed on success.

        If the submitted link already exists it will be an idempotent operation,
        unless the body contains additional metadata. In these cases, the link's
        metadata will be updated with the new metadata and the URL is unchanged.

        When a link is submitted, it is first "cleaned" to remove any fragments.

        Add a participant to an event or change an existing participant's state.

        If the requesting account is an admin or holds MANAGE_EVENTS permission,
        they can change the participation properties of any account. Otherwise,
        they can only change their own participation properties.

        For non-managing members (i.e. not an admin and not a host) this will
        follow a stricter state machine for the participation status. If the
        participation status is not set (no participation record is present) or
        set to "declined", the member may only set their status to "requested"
        if the event policy is set to "invite_only". Otherwise, they may set it
        to "attending". If the member is already set to one of these states,
        they may change it to "declined".

        A non-managing member cannot change their role and the default is
        "attendee", only managing members can change participant roles.

        If the event participation policy is set to "invite_only" then members
        can only set their status to "requested" or delete their participation.

        If the event participation policy is set to "closed", it's a no-op.

        Requests to this resource are idempotent given identical request bodies.
        It acts as a create-or-update action as participation is account-unique.

    Mark:
      description: |
        A polymorphic identifier which is either a raw ID, a slug or both values
        combined and separated by a hyphen. This allows endpoints to respond to
        varying forms of a resource's ID which may be present in different app
        contexts. For example, a slug may be used in a URL but raw IDs are often
        exposed as part of API responses or in certain endpoint parameters. This
        type allows flexibility in user experience as well as the API surface
        while ensuring performance during database queries and other operations.

        For example, given a thread with the ID `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50` and the
        slug `top-10-movies-thread`, Storyden will understand both the forms:
        `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50-top-10-movies-thread` or `cc5lnd2s1s4652adtu50` or
        `top-10-movies-thread` as the identifier for that thread.

        Marks are only ever used on the read path as they are a derivative data
        type and are not stored in the database as-is, while IDs and slugs are.
        The write path typically exposes slugs as writable and IDs as immutable.

        An event represents any kind of event, such as an online or in-person
        gathering, a conference, a workshop, a webinar, etc. Events will contain

        Each event also gets its own thread for discussion and planning. This is
        automatically created for every new event and is linked to the event.
